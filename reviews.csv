1,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,La Guardia to Miami ,November 2023,1,1,,,1,,1,0,Not Verified ,   Delta Airlines customer service was bad. Staff members were unhelpful and unprofessional of the delayed flight. Staff was very rude and even laughed at me while asking questions. I asked the  questions respectfully and I am baffled for the unprofessionalism. No one knew how to give direct answers on how to fix their mistake on my delayed flight. Rather received a mockery attitude and much uncertain answers. Save your money and go fly elsewhere please.

When I pointed out that it was their error and that they gave me the incorrect ticket, they refused to assist me.

However, this was the worst experience in over 35 years of flying. For 839$ (one way!) I got less space and comfort than on Hawaiian Airlines economy.

6,1,,Business,Premium Economy,Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles,October 2023,1,1,1,3,1,3,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," I am writing to express my profound disappointment with the service I received on Delta Flight 800. I have always chosen Delta for its reputation for superior service and reliability, but my recent experience has made me reconsider that choice. To begin with, I was taken aback when, after upgrading to Comfort Class, I was relocated from an aisle seat to a middle seat without any prior notification or choice. Such a switch considerably reduced the comfort level I had anticipated with the upgrade. This was the first sign of my forthcoming ordeal. Upon addressing my concern at the airport, I was given a sheer run-around, being referred from one agent to another, with each passing the responsibility onto someone else. It felt as though my comfort and satisfaction as a customer were not valued in the slightest. My in-flight experience was no better. The flight attendants seemed disinterested and distant, making me feel more like a burden than a valued passenger. My simple request for an apple juice was met with confusion as I was handed a diet coke instead. This may seem like a trivial mistake, but it's indicative of the lack of attention to passenger needs. Moreover, after requesting headsets to perhaps distract myself from the accumulating frustrations, I had to repeat my request. Waiting an hour for such a basic amenity is unacceptable, especially when I could see other passengers receiving prompt service. I had hoped that my upgrade to Comfort Class would ensure a pleasant journey, but I found myself facing a series of disappointments and inconveniences. The lack of coordination, attention to detail, and basic courtesy have left a lasting negative impression. I urge Delta to look into these matters seriously. No passenger should feel as undervalued and disregarded as I did on Flight 800."

This aircraft is comfortable with plenty of legroom; however, the overhead cabins are too small to hold a carry on bag with outside pocket. No delay and smooth flight to LGA. Connecting flight to DFW was on a A220-300. This is an awesome aircraft. If I could fly the A220-300 all the time I would do it. The engines are very quiet. The seats are wider than bigger single aisle planes and very comfortable. The overhead cabins are large enough to accommodate carryon bags. The bathrooms are spacious more so than on larger single aisle planes e.g. B737 and/or A320s. No delay on either leg and the cabin crews were very friendly offering snacks periodically. In flight WiFi worked flawlessly on A220 but was spotty on CRJ 900. I haven't flown DL in quite come time, but I definitely would fly this airline again."
9,8,767-400,Solo Leisure,Business Class,New York to Paris CDG,August 2023,4,5,3,4,2,4,5,1,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I hold a business class ticket from Air France. Air France cancelled my flight and rebooked me with Delta. Things seemed to be smooth as I could select my seat, 1D, and checked on Delta's website that the seat was reserved,  until Delta required me to check-in at the airport. I went to the Delta One section, the check-in agent was very nice and found my reservation, provided to me a boarding pass, only without a seat number. She made several attempts to request for one, but the system only allowed my seat to be assigned at the gate. Not only that, my boarding pass neither showed the class of service nor Sky Priority status, though she ensured me several times that I would be travelling in Delta One. The inconvenience began from there, with the security agent refused to allow me to use the Sky Priority line; not an issue as I was early. I did not get access to the Sky Club; not an issue either as I still could do it with my Amex Platinum card but chose to skip as the Sky Club was packed with a long waiting line. The gate agent finally assigned me a seat, exactly my seat 1D, but only until an hour before boarding. With US carriers having a reputation of dumping passengers for no reason, being through that process is not fun. It got a lot better on board, though not necessarily excellent. Cabin staff were very nice and accommodating. Food was just average in taste, and the whole meal was served on a single tray. I flew Delta One from JFK to Frankfurt a year earlier, and the meal was delicious and was properly served course after course. Not sure why there is such disparity on 2 very comparable routes. The semi-Delta One Suite was more spacious and comfortable than I thought, but it still lagged behind many leading products out there. Why do I still recommend the airline? Because I could see efforts from staff to help me. It was their system that was bad."
10,1,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,San Diego to Detroit,October 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Bad attitude and customer service. I was flying from San Diego to Detroit on Delta. The Delta representative in the boarding was very rude. She made sure to stop me as she said I have three items (backpack, carry-on and small 6x4” crossbody). I had to step out of the lane put my crossbody inside the backpack. I had to lose my flower bouquets (the one my daughter gave me for my birthday) because of my 6x4” crossbody. I’m not sure what was her problem with me, but it was obvious she is not treating everyone equal as three people in front of me, including my husband, had three items with them and she let them go to the plain without saying anything to them. I am very disappointed with Delta staff. Delta was my first stop to shop for flight it will not be anymore for sure. I am using my mileage on the Delta Amex then I will not care about it anymore. You lost a good customer Delta."
11,3,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,May 2023,,,,,,,3,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"   This review pertains to the SkyMiles program. During the months of January and February in 2023, I embarked on a series of flights with Delta's partner airlines, which included LATAM, Aerolineas Argentinas, and Saudia. Regrettably, I failed to input my SkyMiles number when booking these flights. Consequently, I had to request mileage credit post-flight, a process that is typically straightforward. However, my experience with Delta proved to be far from hassle-free. Securing mileage credit from Delta proved to be an ordeal that required multiple requests and calls to customer service before any credit was recorded. It was not until September, a full seven months after my initial application, that I finally received mileage credit for the Saudia flights. Astonishingly, during a call with an agent in March, I was told my requests had been “archieved” and thus not acted upon. Then, when I called again in October, the agent advised that they had no record whatsoever that I had put in any request – this despite the fact that the agent in March had advised that my requests were safely in and I need not put them in again. It wasn't until October, following yet another customer service call, that I was granted the deserved credit for the Aerolineas Argentinas flights. However, the same agent informed me that she was unable to credit me for the LATAM flights, citing allegedly missing information in the documents I provided (boarding passes and receipts). In response, I diligently explained via email that all the requisite information was indeed included in the documents, but received no response. When I acquired a letter from LATAM confirming the presence of all necessary details and forwarded it to the agent with a request for confirmation of receipt, I was met with silence once more. Upon reaching out to Delta customer service to follow up, I was met with an abrupt response, being told that I ""could not keep calling them,"" despite this being only my initial follow-up call, and that further contact would supposedly further delay the process. The agent then refused to provide me with any case number or confirmation number for my call – which goes against most customer service protocols. The culmination of these experiences has led me to the unfortunate realization that Delta's customer service falls far short of the expected standards, characterized by contradictory instructions, leading customers on wild goose chases to obtain information already provided, and gaslighting of customers. It appears that this deliberate ""intentional friction"" is designed with the expectation that customers will eventually abandon their pursuit of rightful mileage credit. Such service is incredibly disappointing for an airline that is purportedly renowned for its high level of customer service in the United States."

Our Delta plane landed on time but had to wait for a gate. I missed my flight by 5 mins. A group of us watched from inside the airport while the plane just sat there. I thought they would wait to close the gate especially since we were going from one delta flight to another. I will avoid booking with Delta from now on and avoid layovers at Atlanta International.

I had a flight scheduled to depart at 4pm and arrive in Atlanta at 6:45 where I needed to connect to another flight that left at 7:10. That main flight delayed 3x and I had to change my connecting flight twice until finally for the 3rd time there were no more connecting flights. They offered me another flight the next day that would arrive too late for my purpose of travel. Thanks to delta I missed my cousins funeral.

Despite the flight attendant attempting to restart it, it still didnt work. I was stuck there for close to 10 hours without any in flight entertainment. I filed a complaint, and only received a measly 10,000 points (monetary value of $100). I replied advising that this felt inadequate, and the response I received was that this was the maximum they offered for this kind of issue. Extremely disappointed, spent $2000 for terrible experience, and all they offer is $100 in return. Will never fly Delta again if I can avoid it."

The only functioning toilet door was very difficult to open and the toilet was cleaned only once during the entire 5hr flight. The reason why I know that is because I was sitting in an exit row close to the toilets. Secondly, one of the flight attendants was rather rude she has no customer service skills and it was evident that she really did not want to do her job. We will never fly with Delta Air Lines again."

Then we landed in Atlanta and our connecting flight was cancelled to Huntsville, AL. They of course blamed weather so they wouldn't have to be held accountable although a flight (DL1726) flew out of Atlanta to Huntsville an hour later. We were told at the ticket counter our next available flight would be 3 days later and if that wasn't ""good enough"" we would have to choose ground transportation and we would be reimbursed for the flight not taken and a rental car. We were given the runaround for over 8 weeks now and over 5 hours of our time for Delta to offer us $25 credit towards our cancelled flight (not money back) and now they won't even reimburse us our $275 rental car to drive through the night to get our child to NASA Space camp on a Sunday.

The agent today that we spoke to from the airport was not helpful and just told us to buy a new ticket which would be over $500. I have been forced to fly another airline separately from my family with great inconvenience. The agent who messed up my reservation on August 22nd should be reprimanded for her incompetence and negligence causing emotional and financial stress. Such agents shouldn't be allowed to work for Delta. Extremely poor service experience both then and today. Pity, I used to think Delta was one of the better airlines ."

We bought flights months ago with miles and the company overbooked the flight. The flight was originally for 10:30 am and they decided to put us on the 7:30 am flight. When I called to fix the problem I was told their rates had gone up and they offered me the original flight but in the main cabin rather than comfort +. I was told I'll have to take the flight and ask for a refund. I was told the refund department will decide if we get a refund or not. I've never had this many problems with American Airlines.
22,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Rochester via New York,September 2023,2,3,2,3,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I've unfortunately already booked a couple more flights with this airline, but that will be the last time. I thought that Delta's standards had improved over the years, but I had the worst airline experience on September 29th at LAX's terminal 3. I got to the airport early and I had my dog in his carrier. I got stopped by a female employee who told me that my dog was too big for his carrier. This is not the case, he is a chihuahua mix, and I have flown with my dog many times with no issues on much longer flights. She did not offer any solutions, just told me I could not fly with the carrier I had. I got in line to talk to customer service to figure out what my options were, and she then ushered me over again with a manager. The manager told me I could only fly with my dog if I purchased a different carrier from Delta. While the manager went to get the carrier, I waited for 45-50 minutes and almost ran out of time to check my bag. When the manager came back, she had a carrier the same size if not smaller than the one I walked in with. I was flustered and just wanted to get on my flight since I was running out of time, and they charged me $75 for a cramped Delta-branded carrier. I was stressed, my dog was stressed, and I had to literally run through the airport, jostling my poor dog, to make my flight in time (5 minutes later and I would have missed it.) It felt like a weird, gross scam and it was the most stressed out I've ever been dealing with an airline before. I fly extremely frequently (6-12 roundtrip flights a year via various airlines) but Delta has lost my business for good."

24,2,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Santiago de Chile via Atlanta,September 2023,1,3,4,5,1,1,4,0,✅ Trip Verified ," One of my worst journeys ever! Our experience started with the inability to check in online on Delta.com and paying for a 3rd additional suitcase, which forced us to get up early and to stand in line at terminal 2 at SFO airport, with the aggressive handling of a red suited male supervisor, making is repack our suitcases. After this stress we made it to near our departing gate for DL 916 to ATL right in time. We wanted to buy a sandwich and the departure screen showed on time for our flight. No sign of boarding, so we took our time. Suddenly the panel changed to last call, a practice I had seen in no other airport in the world. When notifying the harsh eyed lady at the Delta boarding gate, she only shrugged her shoulders and said this was the airport not the airline responsible for this wording. Guest feedback obviously is valued at Delta Airlines. Being a Skyteam frequent flyer with Air France Flying Blue, I wanted to connect to the wifi, but this was only allowed to Delta Skymiles members - or if I wanted to register with Delta Skymiles - an aberration if I am already a member with Flying Blue. Changing flight in Atlanta, we found ourselves in a packed plane and our seats being 50F and E, we could not even place our travelling backpacks in the overhead department, because two of these overheads were filled with the return flight staff equipment, so we had to squeeze these bags between our legs during 9 hours. On top of this Delta has one of the smallest leg space for its economy customers, as seen to this date. A horror of a night in an airplane and hardly will Delta see us ever book them again."
25,2,,Business,Business Class,New York to Nice,September 2023,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Ah, Delta. I have been loyal for over 40 years. In that time, I cannot count the number of times I said ""I love my Delta Airlines"". But lately, Delta has gone downhill. My latest flight international to Nice, FR, I took a chance on ""Premium Select"" class. A complete and utter waste of money. For the same price, I could have flown true business class with half a dozen other airlines - and gotten a full recline sleeper vs the garbage extra 1/2"" seat. I'm talking $1800 more (one way) to fly on Delta. Never again will I fly Delta internationally. Domestically, Delta is a second rate airline - another half dozen budget airlines have better pricing and a better experience. I consider Delta now a ""cattle car"" carrier. And the latest snub on sky miles, I will do everything I can to not fly Delta anymore and promote those airlines who care. Sadly, the Delta employees continue to be the most courteous and professional. But Delta, the writing is on the wall, you will become a ""has been"" airline."

Served on a tray with a pre wrapped cookie. Wow. Highlights were the entertainment system and exemplary service by the lone flight attendant brilliantly and tirelessly serving 20 people on his own.

Flight DL 1689 out of Seattle to Phoenix our connection was very short and had to literally run through the Seattle Airport, which is a nightmare in it self. I had asked a ticket for help in notifying the gate of this dilemma and received no help at all. I am 84 years old and had to run to the gate and when I got there my wife was trying to hold the gate and was told they couldn't do that, very unhelpful. I was last to board and the plane was packed like sardines and our seat was second to last row. To compound the situation, the person behind me was sick and kept sneezing on me between the seats. I could go on but from what I see from Delta, it will fall on deaf ears."
28,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Edinburgh via Atlanta,August 2023,3,4,2,5,4,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I was booked on a flight Aug 24 to Edinburgh through Atlanta. I paid extra for a comfort seat (about $100) after I'd made the initial booking. I made the booking through Orbitz. The ticket was for a Virgin Atlantic flight operated by Delta. Delta called me at 8:57 am, Aug 24, about 10 minutes before I was to leave for the airport. They asked if I would be willing to be re-routed through Boston because MCI-ATL was over-sold. I was offered $300 which was accepted. Comfort seats were not available on the MCI-Boston flight so I was put into the main cabin. I called Delta when I got to the airport to say I also wanted a refund on the comfort seat which was a separate charge on my CC. I was told my CC had already been credited. I called my CC company when I returned and they have no record of impending credits. As of 9/22, it's still not credited. When I got home, I called Delta again and was told they couldn't help me unless I had the MCI-BOS ticket number which I didn't keep and can't find. They said to call Orbitz. Orbit said they couldn't help because Delta called me directly and they didn't have the info. They emailed the flight info they had (MCI-ATL-BOS) which is attached. Orbitz said to contact Virgin Atlantic. Virgin Atlantic also said they couldn't help for the same reason although they forwarded the information I gave them to Delta. I still haven't received a response. Had I been in business class and agreed to be put in the main cabin, I would have credited the difference so why not the $100 I paid for a comfort seat which I'm sure Delta either sold to another passenger or upgraded someone. Everyone else already booked in the main cabin who agreed to switch would have been paid $300. I'm out an extra $100. I have no complaints about the flights themselves or any Delta staff."
29,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to LaGuardia,September 2023,,,,,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  On Sunday September 10, my friend and I were returning back to Toronto from LaGuardia airport. We arrive at the airport and are waiting in the bag check line only to see on the screen that our flight was cancelled due to poor weather conditions. This was a surprise to us because we were not notified of this sudden cancellation until we got to the airport. Why not say something earlier or within the day so that we can plan accordingly? Our flights automatically got moved to Tuesday in the evening and we could stay here another day. We finally get to the front of the bag check line and we speak to the lady about the cancellation. Out of the 11 workers we spoke with during our time at the airport, she was one of the nice ones. We asked her if we could get any other flights tonight and she said there were none. She suggested we go to JFK and try but would not compensate us for travel to get there. Our flight was moved to Tuesday and it was Sunday evening. Where were we supposed to stay? They couldn't give us any hotel accommodations or nothing. They couldn't supply us with any solutions or offer to help or service us in any way which is poor customer service. We couldn't afford another night at a hotel so we actually ended up sleeping in the airport. They couldn't even supply blankets or nothing. We were just cold and freezing in the airport while we looked and googled for earlier flights, which are now double and triple the price. I'm talking $1,000 - $1,500 one way for a flight that was originally 300 or so. They couldnt even give us a refund for the flight. They just told us to call customer service. I had to wait 1-2 hours just to get a refund for that flight. So at this point we had to consider taking a bus until we finally found a flight with Delta the following day in the evening around 300. Fast forward to Monday September 11. We check in our bags go through everything and watching netflix by our gate until it was time to board. I think an hour or so before boarding I get an email saying that this flight is now cancelled. My friend and I check the screen and it still says the flight is on time. We went to the people at the gate who had to confirm whether or not the flight was cancelled. At this point we were getting even more frustrated because the same thing happened again. The customer service couldn't do anything for us. They moved our flight to Wednesday September 13. Again, no accommodation, no refund, nothing. The man acted like he did us a favor by giving us a food voucher for $32. What can $32 buy at an airport for 2 people? It was really frustrating because again we weren't notified until last minute of this cancellation. We decided to call and get another refund on the flight all while finding a bus that we could take to get home. We found 1 that was leaving at 10 pm and not too far from the airport. We purchased non refundable tickets, desperate to get home and thinking we would get there in time. We decided to get our bags that we checked and just take this bus. We headed to baggage claim and this was what really got me frustrated. We got there and our bags were not there! We had to wait 4 hours for our suitcases to come out. I asked countless workers where our bags were and we were either dismissed, ignored or not given a direct answer. Because baggage check took too long we missed the bus we were supposed to take and had to spend another night at the airport. We ended up taking a 6 am bus to finally get back home"

32,2,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Nashville via Toronto,October 2022,2,5,,,1,,1,1,Not Verified ,"  Maintenance was not done to the airplane so they cancelled the flight and booked another one for us. We had to wait 8 hours at the airport. In Canada a credit or compensation must be made as stated by law. At the Delta counter they told the passengers to call Delta for the compensation. Numerous e-mails and calls were made to their customer service. Delta does not intend to conform with the law, which makes them a delinquent company. Now we have to deal with the Canadian transportation agency to get our compensation, which takes time. I don't recommend this airline to anyone and won't travel with them or any of their partners. I did not mind to book with a cheaper airline for a short flight, but we lost our time and energy in the process so we should have booked with a better company in the first place. Lesson learned!

This is unacceptable, they are breaking their own promise. This is the 2nd time Delta has cheated me. In 2023 I was offered an Amex card and 40k miles. I spent the required $4,000 in three months, got the card, used it and instead of the 40k miles promised, I was given only 35k miles which now are going to be converted to annually reset MSD dollars! I protested, I sent them a screen shot of the offer, but I only got a run-around. This is in addition to the much higher requirements for redeeming miles than most all other airlines."

My minor son and I (traveling alone) had to be up at 3am to airport on time. The flight Delta scheduled was not even flying that day. I had to be on the phone for over 30 minutes (while standing in the Prague airport with my child) desperately trying to get someone to change the flight to the correct one so we could make our way home to Boston. We ended up managing to sprint through the airport (mind you, this child also has a serious heart condition!) after having just 15 minutes to get to our gate. Since this trip, I have reached out to Delta to provide feedback, only to have them refuse to take responsibility for their mistake. Instead, they have blamed everyone else and straight out denied this even happened. I have phone records to prove my call took place. But they simply refuse to accept the blame. We will not be using Delta for our next European trip."

A few minutes later, I was boarding and had a comfort plus seat along with my husband. As I gave my boarding pass to get on, a huge siren went off and they told me to step back they needed to speak to me. I moved to the location they requested when a man working for Delta said in a pressured, loud and aggressive tone “There is a problem with your seat, the TV doesn’t work but we can move you to another seat with a working TV.” I hesitated because this all caught me off guard and said ok but show me the seat and it was a middle seat without the extra leg room. I said no and he said “Are you sure?” and I said I was traveling with my husband and if we can’t sit together we will just keep the seat with the broken tv in comfort plus. As it turns out that TV worked and Delta had been trying to give my seat to someone else for more money! About 15 years ago, I flew Delta and again coming back to the US from Athens, Greece I connected in Paris and they did a similar thing and asked me while I was seated in my seat to get up and they gave my seat that I had a ticket for and was already seated in to a man with the explanation that it was really his seat despite me having a paid ticket and boarding pass with that seat number. I had to stay in the airport for 5 hours waiting for another Delta plane. I never forgot that and it took 15 years for me to fly overseas with Delta again and now they did this. I never write reviews but want others to know as well as Delta that I will never fly with them again and will let everyone know about the scam they do, especially overseas to young women to take their seats for other passengers."

At 2am Delta CANCELED the flight and we all had to find hotels and didn't get a flight to late the next day. I didn't even have time to cancel one of my excursions with a 24 hour notice.

44,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Washington,August 2023,3,3,4,4,1,,3,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Don't trust the airline to update you fast enough if your flight is delayed and causes you to miss the next flight. My flight from Portland OR to Washington DC Dulles Airport originally had a layover in Seattle WA. Due to the first flight having a delay due to a light blinking for something that turned out to not be happening and them needing more fuel in order to be able to make the trip safely, I missed my connecting flight in Seattle WA. The flight arrived 5 minutes before the connecting flight was due to depart. I was unable to reach the gate in time, so I got in line for the customer service. I checked my texts, email and the delta app, but nothing showed up as having an alternate route. It took a while to get through the customer service line. When I reached the counter, I was informed that they had automatically booked me on a new flight even though I hadn't received any notification of this change. They printed my new ticket and said the new flight was due to depart in 15 minutes and was at the gate next to them. I walked over to the gate to find out that they had already closed the gate and weren't boarding the plane anymore. Therefore the tickets that customer service had given me were for a flight that had already finished boarding. So, I had to get back in line again. When I talked to the customer service representative, they told me that it was my fault for missing the second flight and because I had a basic ticket they couldn't help me with another flight option. That they could put me on a waiting list for an open seat going in the general direction. They said that I would just have to wait in the airport until a seat became available and they couldn't tell me when that might happen. I couldn't handle this news that I was stranded at the airport and had no idea when I might be getting another flight. I found a place to break down and cry and just before 11am my delta app notified me the info for the alternative flight that I had missed. This made me mad because this was two hours after I had needed it. So I collected myself and went back to customer service counter. The person who helped me didn't treat me like it was my fault for missing both flights and got me new boarding passes. This whole thing could have been avoided if I had gotten my notification about the reroute a lot sooner or if the customer service person had given me a ticket for a flight that hadn't closed there gates then say it wasn't their responsibility for the missed flight. Then on my last flight, the overhead space was a bit harder to reach then other planes and I am 4'11"". When I had asked a flight attendant for help because I could reach they attendant told me she wasn't allowed to help me, which didn't bother me. But while I was struggling to pick up my bag high enough, the attendant told me that I was holding people up. A passenger ended up catching my bag as I was about to drop it and helping me the rest of the way."

It took them a month to reply and offer me a laughable $25 voucher for future travel because it was due to factors outside of their control.

49,1,,Family Leisure,First Class,Los Angeles to San Antonio,August 2023,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ," The first horrible experience with Delta was on our departure day of Thursday, 08/17/2023 departing from San Antonio, TX. My twin boys and I boarded at 3:41 Delta Flight 1043, which had us wait inside the plane in 80+ degrees (inside the aircraft) for over a 1 hour while the crew tried to fix the AC and mechanical issues the plane was experiencing. This caused a delay in our arrival, and our plans changed due to the fact that we missed our car rental and hotel arrival time. After we departed San Antonio, it was hard to relax and watch a movie as the aircraft was having issues with the monitors, and they kept turning on and off three to four more times until they rebooted the system. On our return flight scheduled for Monday, August 21, 2023, our flight was delayed four times before arriving at the airport at 1 PM. While we sat at the airport waiting from 1 PM to 6 PM our flight was delayed two to three more times. Finally, after waiting all afternoon/evening at the airport, at around 9-10 PM we received a message from Delta saying our flight was delayed until 9 AM the next morning August 22, 2023. The Delta attendant informed us that the delay was due to the fact that Delta could not find a Pilot and the replacement pilot they found earlier, had declined as well, so they were left with no pilot and no choice but to push the flight until the next day. The customer service representative helped us book a hotel and offered us an embarrassing and very offensive $15 voucher per person. We arrived at the hotel with no clothes to change into, no toothbrush, no toothpaste, no hairbrush, no pajamas, and no deodorant, with absolutely nothing but dirty clothes we had on from waiting all day at the airport. It was almost 11 PM at night and every store was closed at this time to try and purchase anything. My kids (two 11-year-old boys) were tired, bored, and very impatient. Also, because it was past 11 PM we were extremely tired, and due to most restaurants and stores being closed we were unable to use the food vouchers. We had to wait an additional 20 to 30 minutes for the hotel shuttle to finally pick us up from the airport and drop us off at the Sheraton Hotel. The next day our flight finally departed LAX and we were extremely disappointed to be placed in an old and dirty aircraft with smaller TVs than the normal ones (We booked 6 first-class seats), please see the attached pictures for reference. We also left our vehicle at the San Antonio, TX airport for when we arrived and we had to pay two extra days of car storage at the airport due to our delay, which we do not think is fair. As if that wasn't disappointing enough for Delta, we received an email on 08/22/2023 from Customer Care offering us a $100 Voucher for the horrible experience. Due to the fact that our flight was delayed over 4 hours and per the trip delayed coverage in Delta's guidelines, we are entitled to up to a $700 travel voucher per ticket (4 tickets) and reimbursement for items we paid for during this delay. Delta refuses to take accountability for their actions and only offer us $20 vouchers."
50,2,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Mexico City to London via Atlanta,August 2023,4,4,2,,1,,2,0,Not Verified ,"  I'm moved to write this review by Delta's extraordinary incompetence and unresponsiveness after a journey that should have taken 15 hours took 50 hours over the weekend of 12/13 August. Our plane from Mexico City was diverted by a storm 20 minutes from Atlanta and landed in Savannah (presumably because of lack of fuel – this was not a great choice of airport, as it has no customs for an international arrival). As a result of this, we sat on the tarmac for 5.5 hours (beyond the legal limit of 4 hours), given nothing to eat but a small bag of chips and two glasses of water. It turns out there were three such planes stranded on the tarmac that afternoon, one with no food or water and no functioning bathroom. The incident made the local online news and TV and was described as ""unprecedented"". Eventually night fell, the pilots left and we were deplaned and processed through a makeshift customs office, then told to find our own accommodation as Delta had no vouchers, but were explicitly told to keep all receipts. Airport staff booked a hotel for me and three fellow passengers. If I had known I wouldn't be refunded I might have slept in the airport. The next morning we showed up at Savannah Airport at 9 for our 11:30 40-minute flight back to Atlanta. I was rebooked onto my Virgin ATL-LHR flight at 6:40 pm. But we didn't leave Savannah till 5:30 pm! First, we were told the plane needed cleaning, then, as time passed, that Delta were now obliged to rebook every single passenger, including their onward flights, by hand, using a defective printer, and they would call them each by name. Chaos ensued, and the flight kept being delayed by another hour. Half the passengers left and hired cars out of frustration. Of course I missed my Atlanta-London connection for the second time in 24 hours. I was luckily rebooked onto a 10 pm Delta flight to London (not in Premium, which I had booked on my original Virgin flight). We were emailed $400 in Delta vouchers, not as a measure of our inconvenience but as a token gesture of apology. I would simply have liked a clean measure of my inconvenience. When I submitted $250 of receipts to Delta for reimbursement, I spoke to a representative about how I would receive the payment and was told a cheque would be emailed to my UK address. Subsequently, Delta informed me that none of my expenses were eligible for reimbursement as bad weather had caused the disruption. This, however, takes no account of a) their duty of care to stranded passengers and b) the sheer incompetence of Delta staff the following day at Savannah airport which caused many people to miss their onward connections. I have tried texting and calling and have repeatedly been fobbed off and held in lines. Delta, I should say, issued a useful food voucher of $30 at Atlanta airport (this was around 8 or 9 pm, though, the first food we had been given all day) and I was then emailed a transport voucher of $35 (for what?) which wasn't actually in the email. On the phone to Delta this week, I was offered 5000 miles as a token to shut me up, which I refused. And in an email I was sent a conciliatory $90 voucher, again not actually accessible from the email. I won't let this drop. Virgin, by contrast, have been charming and helpful, and promised me some refund on my non-flown Premium leg."
51,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Knoxville via Atlanta,July 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Delta’s slogan is “The world’s most trusted airline”? What an absolute crock! I can’t believe how this company operates is even legal, their airline customer service is by far the worst that I have ever experienced. I am absolutely disgusted with Delta Air Lines, they absolutely ruined the first day of vacation for my family and myself. They delayed our 5:30am flight 7 HOURS due to a mechanical issue. It ruined our entire first day of our vacation and we ended up having to book with a different airline last minute because Delta had nearly no other same day flight options except a red eye late night flight. We spent 5 hours in line trying to find other options, and probably over 10 hours by now on hold waiting to get customer service agents to pick up and help. We have spoken to 4 agents at least, and none have been willing to help or hold Delta accountable for the major inconvenience we had in our vacation due to their own doing. They cost us another 500 dollars each for the last minute flight change and only refunded us for the first half of the original trip. They are now refusing to cover the other flights we had to book even though the first customer service representative we talked with while at the airport during this mess told us they would, and have refused to provide any sort of voucher either. While we stood in line at our gate waiting to talk to the Delta attendant for help during all of this, they were giving out 1800 dollar vouchers for an overbooked flight and letting the volunteer passengers cut the line in front of us even though we had already been standing for an hour to rebook their flights. We didn't have a choice to be delayed due to Delta's maintenance issue and yet they are refusing to compensate us at all for any of our experience. It is totally negligent. The customer service reps told us they will do nothing for us and have refused to help any further. "

53,1,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to St.Lucia,August 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  My husband and I have always placed Delta as the best of the best airlines ever! We do not believe that anymore. Our travel agent booked our trip in February 2023 for our upcoming thirty eighth anniversary in August 2023. We arrived early at Atlanta on August 14, 2023. We did everything we were suppose to do, then went to our gate and sat waiting an hour and 15 minutes to board (Gate E15) When they called for Comfort Plus we excitedly got in line to board our flight D1970. When the agent scanned my passport and ticket it would not go through, the agent, who had a horrible attitude asked, where are you flying to?! I stated St. Lucia, she said they changed the flight to boarding gate E10 and the plane has already left. My husband and I were furious because nothing was announced, nor was our name called to let us know of the last minute change. My husband attempted to ask the Delta Rep when did the flight change? She rudely stated, I don't know sir. All I know is the flight gate was changed to E10, they were to depart at 9:45 am, but they departed earlier. My husband asked, what time did they depart? She stated at 9:43 sir. Please move out of the line. We missed our flight. We went to the Delta desk and the agent was no better. We advised her of what had happened and she said, I don't see that your flight was changed to another gate? She then kept looking and said, oh yeah, at the last minute they changed it, and you and your wife are listed as a no show. By this time we are heartbroken. We asked if there was another flight going out? She responded not today. We called our travel agent and she got a Delta Rep on the line for Delta Vacations and she was very unsympathetic. Our travel agent kept asking what could we do to fix this? The agent stated for us to go back to the Delta desk and see if they could book us on an other flight. We again advised we were told there were no more flights going out. We went back to the Delta help desk and the agent had the nerve to say: I don't know why they sent you back to me. They can see the same thing I can. She repeated that statement six times before saying there was nothing she could do. We called for a shuttle to return us back to our hotel, having to pay another $167 plus tax. Our travel agent was able to get us booked on the next day flight August 15, 2023 (this is our anniversary day). She got a Delta Rep on the line to see what compensation could be done and every agent we spoke to was adamant nothing could be done because it was our fault we missed the plane. We ended up losing a whole day (August 14,2023) at the resort, and had to spend more money for a hotel stay. To say the very least we are extremely disappointed in the way things were handled with Delta and will be using American Airlines or another airline moving forward."

The door was still open, but the woman gate attendant wouldn’t let us board. Now we’re stuck in the Seattle airport with 5 little children, no luggage, no car seats. It boggles the mind that the woman at the gate would actually do this. We have no idea what we’re going to do now. Sleep in the airport, I guess, with no bedding or change of clothes.  I will never fly Delta again, and I will discourage everyone I know not to, as well."
55,2,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Toronto via Atlanta,August 2023,2,1,2,1,5,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," I traveled round trip to Canada and had to purchase a lay over flight because there was no flexibility for direct flights with decent arrival times. I had delays on BOTH trips (on 8/3 and 8/13). On my first round I traveled a red eye so I slept for most of the flight, did not eat or drink anything. When I woke up I asked the flight attendant if I could have water as she was making her trash pick up rounds. It was approximately 25-30 minutes before our landing time so I told her 'no rush' since I knew she was making her rounds. She looked at me and said, 'we're about to land'. I am a frequent flyer and I have NEVER been made to feel uncomfortable for a cup of water. I responded with, 'you know what, it's fine. I don't need it.' Another flight attendant brought me a cup once she was done with her rounds. Seriously, that's all she needed to do. I made her job easy through the entire flight by knocking out and staying out of her way until I needed ONE cup of water 30 MINUTES before landing. This is the last time I book with Delta. I gave them an extra star because the other flight attendants were cool but if you're going to delay my flight AND treat me like I'm bothering you when I ask for water you won't see me in those planes again. Also, they promote on flight entertainment yet have no bluetooth option for people with earbuds and you don't offer earphones in order to use the entertainment option you claim to offer. It makes zero sense. I had to resort to playing games since I had no old school earphones that plug into YOUR device. I'm glad I wore comfortable shoes b/c they changed gates AT LEAST 5 times when I waited in Atlanta and twice when I waited in Minneapolis. Like come on guys, we're paying tons of money for a service and I flew the lowest level. I would have been PO'd if I paid for First or Business class! Lastly, the on flight WiFi was so bad that I didn't use it after all. I contacted customer service to get into the online account before my flight on 8/3 and have not heard back from anyone. At this point I think they ignored my request for assistance."
56,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"New Orleans, LA to Augusta, GA via Atlanta, GA",August 2023,3,2,1,,1,3,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Absolutely the worst flight experience ever! We do not recommend Delta. We booked our flight to fly my bf to GA to haul my RV with my truck to TN (job change) while I drove the car and had limited time to get it moved and get him back in time to make his flight for offshore work. So we opted for flying rather than driving to save time. That is not what happened. What was supposed to be 4.5 hours of travel time, including layover, turned into 19+ hours of travel due to Delta’s over 15 hours of delays. You read this right (we could have drove from LA to GA then to our final destination TN in less time than it took Delta to fly him). They had multiple delays (starting with staffing deficiencies). They left him stranded multiple times, literally, both at the airport with shuttle buses down for the night then left him stranded on a plane for over 6 more hours in delays, a detour to Savannah, more delays, refuelling more than once, before finally arriving 15 hours past his booked arrival time. This put us in terrible position and struggling with time constraints, put us in daytime traffic jams, and eventually having to rebook his return flight when we ran out of time due to Deltas unacceptable 15+ hours in delays. It cost us $135 more (taxi cost when stranded at the airport unable to get to the hotel and $100 in fees to rebook the return flight when we ran out of time due to Delta’s multiple extended delays) an enormous amount of stress, aggravation, and lost time. Delta’s offer to resolve this, a pathetic $40 flight voucher! This is not acceptable. We were not able to speak to a person and instead was forced to text, which added to the stress and aggravation. Worst customer service program we have had the displeasure to have to work through. We understand delays can happen but over 15 hours of multiple delays for such a short flight and leaving people stranded multiple times is unreasonable and unacceptable.

57,1,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Lisbon to New York JFK,August 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  In the past month and a half I have taken 3 delta flights. Like clockwork they provide outstanding customer service and lost all my bags every time! I flew from ATL to Boston Logan and they failed to load my bag on my flight. Like the professionals Delta are, it was loaded on the next flight an hour behind.  I was disappointed to hear I would be receiving my bag relatively quickly since it was on the next flight. However, my hopes were lifted when Delta told me it would take three days for them to deliver the bag a whopping 2 hour drive from Boston Logan to Hanover, NH. Thank goodness for Delta’s initiative or else I would’ve had to do a presentation in different clothes from those I’d worn the past two days! And I loved how unbelieving they were in my testimony when I tried to get them to compensate me for the clothes I had to buy because of their failure, absolutely beautiful. I was inspired by Deltas commitment to faithful customers, hard work, and service when I was flying from Atlanta to Boston and then to Lisbon for a vacation. Even when a storm came through ATL and they couldn’t seemingly find a crew to fly the plane they delayed my flight and made me wait for 3 extra hours. Lo and behold this delay would cause me to miss my connection in Boston, but no worries the Delta receptionist were available and attentive to my plight. They helped me reschedule my flight to Amsterdam. And they even remembered to forget that my bags had to be moved onto the new plane. I know when I fly Delta they have and deserve my utmost confidence in losing my bags. I wouldn’t receive these bags for the next two days and honestly it ruined the first half of my vacation. Obviously Delta will bear no shame in destroying my vacation. After I thought all was good they do something really great. I mean this just goes to show you the dedication they have to being a top tier airline. After they lose all 7 of my bags flying to Lisbon they actually don’t lose my bags coming back to New York. I was disappointed to hear my bags had landed in JFK. But upon waiting through my two hour layover I soon began to realize the baggage carousel wasn’t going to move.  I wait there for two hours waiting for my bags to come through the claim so that I could recheck them for my flight home. Guess what, they never came. So as I sit here on board a Delta flight back home, without my bags, I have come to be truly amazed by Deltas intelligence, dedication, and service. Guess I’ll go home and wait 2-3 more days before I have any of my bags. It’s okay though I don’t have anything to do. Delta should just take my bags and give the clothes and items to their staff. Open em up like secret Santa gifts at the office. I don’t care anymore."

Take-off was delayed an hour or so due to weather. My plane eventually got in line to take-off from Atlanta. Waited in the take-off line for 45 minutes until the captain announced that the plane needed more fuel to take a detour? Spent another hour going back to the gate and “getting more fuel”. Another hour passes by and the plane finally takes off. We make it over Augusta around 12:00PM, the pilot announced they were circling around to see if it was safe to land. Next thing I know, we’re headed to Savannah, GA. Land in Savannah at 12.36pm, meanwhile the plane that left after us from Atlanta, landed in Augusta at 12.46pm. At 1.00pm my pilot tells everyone that they are going to wait for the storm to pass over Augusta before going back. My ride at the Augusta airport sent me photos of a clear skies at the Augusta airport. Pilot kept saying “they found a way around the storm and we will be leaving soon” - As if they were doing us a favor. It is now 1.50pm and the passengers are agitated and the flight attendants are arguing with each other. With no word on when we will be leaving to go to the destination we all paid for. No refunds, no apologies, typical."
60,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Sarasota,August 2023,,,,,1,,1,0,Not Verified ," My mother flew from Prague to Amsterdam and into Atlanta with no issue, but for some reason, Delta had a full meltdown in the hub city. After nearly being up for 24 hours of travel, her flight was delayed because of staffing issues, then three hours later, they boarded the plane, only to then return to the gate after taxiing and told the flight was canceled. My mom was then in the chaos of the line for flight/hotel accommodation for 3 hours. The call time for support is over a 2-hour wait. After filing a complaint with Delta about my mother not having access to her luggage I received a canned email blaming the cancellation on the weather. This is a lie. Other Delta flights took off after the cancellation (one that another family member was on). "

I booked a flight for unaccompanied minors through a delta agent on the phone (credit card rewards had to be done this way). The agent completely ruined our experience. It was not until I arrived at the airport for check in that I was told there was a $300 fee ($150 each way) for the unaccompanied minors. I have sent them on other airlines without this charge. In addition to that, the return flight was booked as the last flight out. It’s Delta policy that they cannot take the last flight in case something happened and the minors were stranded. Makes complete sense, but again we were not informed of this issue when the DELTA agent booked it for us. This caused us to reschedule to another day, waste trips and parking fees to the airport, and take another day off work. So a rundown of surprise expenses due to the inept booking agent: Minor fee- $300 Airport parking- $30 Gas and taking time off work- $$ The airport agents were extremely understanding but limited with what they could offer. After submitting a claim explaining all of this with receipts, customer service granted me a $25 voucher for future flights. Use another airline that actually cares if things go wrong, especially when responsible."
62,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Buffalo,July 2023,3,3,,,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  We arrived in Detroit from Orlando and was expecting an approximate 1 hour lay over before heading to Buffalo International. Upon arrival in Detroit I received a notification that our flight would be delayed until 02:30. It was subsequently delayed two more times I believe, and then as we were preparing to board at nearly 03:00 the flight was canceled due to the pilot calling off or something to do with the pilot. Several Delta flights that night were delayed or canceled and I heard staffing mentioned by personnel for at two other gates. There were not other flights going out due to it being 3am and no other flights to Buffalo until approximately 36 hours later. I think there were only 3-4 Delta personnel in the airport to assist us but none of them could really help. I actually felt bad for them as they were taking a lot of grief from some very frustrated people. I connected with Delta at one of their service phones and was not really given any options and asked for a refund on my tickets so I could try to find alternate transport for my family of 6. I was told I would get $60 per ticket due to us completing the first leg of the trip (Orlando to Detroit). That was the morning of 7/22. It is 8/9/23 now and after a lot of follow up between Delta and the booking company, I am finally getting confirmation of the refund. However, I am only being refunded $32.14 per ticket, not $60. Since Delta could not fulfill their obligation to get my family home, we had to rent a vehicle, drive 6 hours home after spending 7 hours in the airport. I had to return that vehicle the following morning, to Detroit, so another 6 hours on the road. Since there are no one way rentals out of Detroit. I then had to wait approximately 5 hours in the airport to fly back to Buffalo. I was at least able to get my family home ... the new plane ticket cost me about $500 and the rental was around $250 and instead of getting home early Saturday morning, I spent the entire weekend traveling and did not get complete the trip until Sunday night. I am getting a refund of approximately $180 from Delta. I will never intentionally fly into Detroit airport and if I can help it, I will never fly Delta again. This has been a horrible experience overall."

My shirt got wet from the sink and I don't want to think about what other substances might have contacted my clothing. Its just gross.

The day after we tried to track our luggage again only to get told that we need to call Delta Support. We called Delta Support and asked them where our luggage is. We were informed that our luggage will come to Europe on 6th of August and that when the luggage is being transported by a different company it won't show on the app which is completely outrageous when they can at least put the flight number of the plane of which the luggage is being transported by.

Not only did they have this happen to us on July 20th on our trip to San Diego - due to staff shortage (left hundreds if not thousands of customers stranded in Atlanta) at midnight - with no hotels, no food, and a failed attempt two days later to buy us off with a $35 e Voucher. Delayed, delayed and then cancelled the flight and then even cancelled their alternative flight - spent whole night on floor in Atlanta terminal chasing flights. Thanks Delta. Then on our return trip - they did it again - they due to staff shortages - delayed flights and caused missed connections. Delta alternative was sleep in terminal again - midnight arrival to fly out next day at 9am. Unacceptable - so we got stuck renting a car in Atlanta at midnight to drive the remaining leg of our trip 3 hours. Deltas response - no reimbursement because we didn't accept their next morning flight. Laughable customer service. Speaking of which - try contacting their customer service - its a joke. It's all automated and they only talk by CHAT. Spend a good hour there - and then be told - sorry we cant see case numbers - you have to call. So you call the numbers - and guess what - they are disconnected saying you have to go to the website and use the Chat. Idiotic. Delta is a joke. They are overbooking flights and not reducing flights to look better for shareholders when their flights do not have staff. Then when the poor ticket holders get to locations - Delta delays their flights or cancels them (they already have the ticket holder $$) and then Delta tries to figure it out last minute. Grow up Delta, if you are short on staff, stop booking or offering flights you can't staff and then sticking it to the ticket holders and when it goes south (which it does) don't try and buy us off with pennies on the dollar e-vouchers.

73,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Piedmont,July 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ," My experience with Delta has been beyond unacceptable the lack of customer service is quite disturbing considering the high recognition they received on top of being apart of the program for two years now. On July 30,2023 my domestic travel plans went from a 5hr travel day to 15 HOURS due to a minimum of a 585 min delay on my first flight which was never notified until a hour before boarding. Then, I was automatically rebooked for the next flight which followed by hours later being delayed again yet this time no notification until I arrive at the airport to print out my boarding pass. Yesterday, I had to travel three times to the airport just to make it home. With every flight rebooked being delayed I had no choice but to completely travel to Detroit just to make it make to GSO. I was never offered comfort at the gate nor on the flight for the inconvenience. Not one voucher or appropriate compensation was offered. Imagine being given the run-around by agents at the gate and customer care just to find out the following day none of the 7 phone calls to customer care on my travel day were EVER documented. Delta you should be ashamed that you cannot live up to the loyalty and funds your consumer provides you. Being offered only $75 dollars worth in SkyMiles or $175 gift card is insane when you have spent well over $400 combined. After I specifically informed the ATL supervisor today that yesterday a representative offered $250, she told me verbatim the because it was not documented she cannot accommodate me. Yet, with no hesitations the supervisor tells me if decline her today she will have to document this. Honestly is this how you all treat your consumers? Its truly disheartening the only solution this airline has for me is to fill out a complaint comment and wait and wait when I have waited more than enough on July 30,2023. It is clear to me that the airline does NOT CARE and has me reconsidering everything associated with this airline!"

We have been using a good $10-20k a month on our card, we pay $550 a year and have never had an upgrade or been treated like a status they claim, no VIP, no Standby upgrades, It’s all a load of hype with no outcomes and only empty hopes and promises. When you call, everyone just passes you on to someone else with no solutions! The accommodations were lacking and unorganized. Waiting in line for 2 hours at an airport after flights were delayed so long we missed our connecting flight, then 4 hours at baggage to wait for missed plane luggage! To finally get our luggage that was damaged, I had no medication for way to long. By 1am we could not find any place to accept the food voucher, there was no shuttle to go to a hotel Delta gave us 30 mins away by the time we finally got a hotel, my bags were damaged and we were promised to be compensated to make up for these troubles and they are not offering anything close to fair. After one hour on the phone, 3 agents, multiple answers, no help, we were passed to the lowest customer service Delta rep I have ever spoke with! This did the final for me, so inexperienced yo handle any situations for a stressed out and upset customer who has been through the loop holes to try to get reimbursed and her attitude was just nasty and rude.  Delta is horrible and don’t listen to the customer, they also are not accommodating to people who have been through a tough time during their DELTA flight issues and especially the after the flight issues. I am not a happy Delta member. We are rethinking our choices, rethinking our membership and which card/company I we should look into because of the whole process of this last month with Delta and how they have been handling our situation is the worst experience I have ever had, ruining our family experience that is so hard to have and put together with our demanding schedules these days of precious time and a waste of my sanity and yearly money."

Attendant also skipped over my son when handing out snacks and I had to push the call button and then physically wave down an attendant to get him something. The car seat buckle I have to attach my son's car seat to a rolling dolly looks exactly like a seatbelt extender and went missing while on flight. My best guess is someone grabbed it off the seat next to me or off the floor and too it thinking it was an extender. We were the last people on the plane (mom + toddler) and I was nearly in tears because now I had a loose car seat and toddler to manage through an airport. There was a pile of seat belt extenders on a seat but I was told those were theirs and sorry but someone must've taken mine. They told me to go to the Delta help desk so I did. Trying to hold back my tears as I'm struggling to manage, I asked the help desk for help and they called a manager on me and treated me like a criminal or something. Another couple at the help desk mouthed ""sorry"" to me and were wide eyed at the way I was being treated. I've never ever had such a horrible experience flying.

After 6 weeks someone finally called me to talk about the ticket I sent in as a concern and wanting to speak to someone where a super visor did absolutely nothing and didn’t seem concerned at all. I notified her about a couple I spoke to at the airport that was given a $500 voucher each as well as seat upgrades and she told me numerous times that wouldn’t happen as Delta does not give more than $100 voucher.

We left on 7/3 from Boise on a one hour, straight flight to Seattle. When we arrived, we discovered that some how my mother's luggage had been lost. I'm not sure how that can possibly happen on such an easy flight. We had to wait at the Delta baggage claim for 3 1/2 hours for them to finally tell us they would open a case. They had no idea where my mom's bag was. Our plan was to fly into Seattle, get a rental car and drive about 2 1/2 hours away to Ocean Shores. This put us way behind schedule and left my mom with NOTHING - no clothes, no toothbrush, no heart medication. She trusted that Delta would get her bag to its location. For Pete's sake, we weren't taking an international flight with layovers! The next morning Delta called and said they located my mom's bag but that they couldn't deliver it to us because we were too far away and they couldn't ship it via UPS because it was a holiday. By the time Delta would have been able to ship my mom's bag to us, we would have already been returning to the airport at the end of our short vacation. My mom paid to check her bag both ways ($60) just to not have any access to it - plus the stress of not knowing where it was, waiting for hours, and the inconvenience of having none of the items that she brought to accommodate her vacation. She had to spend about $150 of replacement clothes, toothbrush, etc. I contacted Delta after the trip and requested nothing other than that they refund the $60 we paid to check the bag both ways. They would only offer a flight credit good for 12 months.... UNBELIEVABLE. We will not be flying in 12 months so I again asked for a cash refund instead. They refused.

My flight from Indianapolis was delayed for 30 min but was still on time to get to the connection in ATL. The connection flight was delayed as well for about 1h, then finally we boarded the connection flight. The pilot then told us that there is something wrong with the engine that they would attempt to resolve the issue. About 45min later the pilot told us that we will be asked to deplane as this issue would not be resolved today. He also said that he had been flying for 16 hours straight and would not be able to take us to our destination even if they found another plane. The customer service line was extremely long and after 1h30 AM wait, an employee told us that unfortunately there was no more voucher for hotels. At the same moment we all start receiving rebooked flights notices for 9:30pm, so we were to stay at the airport for 20h. When I spoke to the staff they were very dismissive. I informed them that i have a hip issue and could not sit or stand for so long but they told me to go find myself a hotel and maybe Delta would refund me $100 of it. I asked that they get me my luggage back because i needed to take my blood pressure medication but they said i would have to wait until it arrives in MD. I bought a ticket with Southwest for $200 and was able to get home. Delta is only offering to refund the part of their flight that i did not use, but i paid more last minute with Southwest to get home. "

I do not eat that, coach had chicken Caesar salad, chicken salad sandwich and some sort of charcuterie option! Now granted they were going to pay extra for ordering any of those but I paid ahead by flying first class and had one nasty option. The flight attendant didn't like that I don't like Caesar salad and gave me attitude the rest of the flight. We also had no WiFi. Going into Hawaii every family needs agricultural forms to fill out, this flight didn't have enough forms and NO pens! They told us a million times the flight was full, so take your own advice and have enough stuff for everyone. They made everyone who did not have a form stay on the flight until they got more forms and filled them out. As a first class passenger with my bags tagged priority they are supposed to come out first, we'll they came out almost last! Flight home, no drinks while waiting for everyone to board, my husband had no blanket and pillow like everyone else in first class, he asked for it, they brought him two blankets because they were out of pillows. He ordered a special meal which they did NOT have!! The only option for dinner was a turkey sandwich and chips! These flight attendants do not call you by name, they could care less that I spent $2000 more per ticket than those sitting in coach and I might as well have been there! Nothing special at all about Delta first class! I will never fly them again, coach or first class"
85,2,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Nashville,July 2023,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I understand that things happen and that flights can be delayed, but what i did not appreciate is that Delta had us for 3 hours and 30 minutes inside a plane that was still waiting for orders to take off, in the mean time inside the plane was super hot and the plane was at full capacity, and the only thing that Delta gave us was a mini bottle of water and a single mini chips bag. It felt insulting to even be offered that, the least they should’ve done was to give us a meal, because most of the passengers haven’t had dinner yet at that time. We were inside the plane from 6:15 pm and the plane took off from the airport runway around 9:45 pm. Very disappointing, i was considering getting the sky miles credit card, but with this experience, i don't think I will now."

Flight from Atlanta delayed at least 3 times. No rhyme or reason given. Very disappointing and discouraging. No reason to have to pay outrageous prices for such poor, inept and substandard service. I was on one plane and thank God it was not an emergency - the acoustics were abominable. Could not understand a word the steward was saying. I would think thus would be an FCC violation!!

I am 6’ 4” tall and travel for the military with all my stuff. I have a backpack with computers, important document etc and I have to make it fit under the seat because the other travelers won’t check the huge carry on roller bag at the side of the plane (for free)!

88,1,,Business,Economy Class,New Orleans to Indianapolis via Atlanta,July 2023,3,4,1,3,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Flying with Delta was the worst experience. Coming back from a business trip, our first leg of the trip was from New Orleans to Atlanta. The second leg was to go on the Indianapolis. The plane was a half hour late. I won’t go into all the details, but the plane was further delayed, getting up to Atlanta and hour late. Since there was a storm, we were unable to land. The pilot mentioned we were low on fuel so he decided to take us to Destin FL. We sat in Destin a long time, finally refueled, and headed back to Atlanta. We had to “Park” because there was no gate for us. We missed our connecting flight but found out Delta had automatically booked us on an early morning flight. Good, Right? We decided to wait it out in the airport. The next morning we saw the rebooked flight was canceled. No notice from Delta. No subsequent rebooking. The lines to rebook were well over a mile long. Checking online, all flights were full with the exception of connecting flights that would take us further away. We did NOT want to chance that. We ended up getting a flight with another airline that would leave at 3pm. We feel as if Delta Airline abandoned us at the Atlanta airport with no way home."

Although the food was good, and the aircraft itself was clean and comfortable, the flight attendants were horrible. Amari and another guy were very inconsiderate of the customers in first class. They were both loud, constantly talking and laughing, slamming doors, behaving like they were at home hanging out in their living room. It was hard to sleep on the flight or just close my eyes for a little to rest. Very disappointing because all of the customers in first class were quiet and well behaved. When we're paying this kind of money for first class I expect better."
96,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Utah,June 2023,1,4,1,3,2,2,1,0,Not Verified ,"  I am a long-time Delta customer and have been loyal for many years, but I am going to cancel my account and will refuse to fly with them again. This was an absolutely terrible experience. My flight was delayed, and we were told at the terminal that it would be ""at least an hour,"" and that it would probably be longer. I went to eat something and came back in an hour, and the plane was gone and the terminal empty. At the Delta desk, I was told it had gone. They said other people missed it as well. Of course, they had announced the flight over the intercom and sent passengers an email, but where I was told it would be ""at least"" an hour, I ate without listening to the many constant announcements or checking my phone. Delta booked me on standby for a flight late that night, but unfortunately did not inform me that it was an overbooked flight. There was no room on that flight. I had to travel late and stay the night in a nearby town and wake up the next morning for another flight, traveling on little sleep. I had to reschedule one of the most exciting meetings of my life with a new mentor. We met that night much more briefly, with me totally frazzled and stressed. So essentially, I spent extra money on food and transportation, lost sleep, missed work, wasted many hours, had to travel late and stay overnight, had a panic attack in the empty terminal, and missed a once-in-a-lifetime meeting with a hero and new mentor of mine. I understand that these things happen and reached out professionally to Delta, and they emailed me apologizing and saying they would add 3,000 miles to my SkyMiles account. Turns out that 3,000 miles are worth about $30. I have seen overbooked Delta flights offer people credit cards for $500 or more, just like that. I lost so much time and money with this experience. I asked if I could talk to someone else, remaining friendly with the individual since I know it's a company policy and customer service staff are not to blame, but the email I got back said, ""Thank you for writing us back. I've utilized all my resources and have been advice by my leadership team that no further compensation can be issued. Regrettably we're unable to honor your request. We realize this is a disappointment, and trust you understand our position. We do appreciate your persistence but we will have to agree that we cannot find the right solution this time. Any further communication would not be productive and we will not respond again regarding this incident. We hope in time we'll have the opportunity to restore your confidence in our service. Take care and have a wonderful day!"" ""We will not respond again regarding this incident"". Delta has completely lost its once-great customer service and has gone downhill with mileage benefits, cost, seating options, and the whole experience. They try to scrape money from travelers in any way they can and offer us nothing when they mess up. Delta has lost my trust."

Flight was on the ground not at the gate when we arrived, they told us they didn’t “know where it was”. Then after an hour late we were told it was in a hangar getting an issue fixed. We waited another hour for an update. They said they didn’t really know what was going on - the plane was still in the hangar. After 3 hours they brought then plane to the gate but it still had not been cleaned. Finally after 4 hours, we boarded. Another technical issue had to reconnect bridge. Then taxing for 20 mins they discovered another technical issue and we had to return to the gate. The pilots had timed out so the flight was cancelled at 3.30am. I was told I would get a hotel and meal voucher by email but never did. Rescheduled on a flight the next day - very little communication from Delta. The communication on the ground in Atlanta was rude and unhelpful. I thought Delta was supposed to have amazing customer service?"

106,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to Phoenix via Dallas,June 2023,2,2,,2,2,3,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Terrible experience. We arrived at the airport more than 3 hours earlier than our flight departure time. Before we arrived at the airport, we were constantly checking the Delta app, and it always showed that the flight was on time. When we checked in (3 hours before our flight) the counter person let us know there was a ""slight"" delay. We were in the airport from 5 p.m. until 11 p.m. At 11 p.m. Delta announced that the flight would be delayed until 11 a.m. the next morning. We went back to the counter, and the counter person took quite a while to find a solution that would allow us to arrive at our final destination, Phoenix. We were somewhat confused because other airlines (JetBlue) still had flights that were flying out that night to JFK. The counter person finally found a solution for us. The solution involved sending us to a hotel, where we would spend one night. Then from the hotel, a taxi would pick us up and drive us 5 hours to a completely different airport (Punta Cana.) We did make it to the Punta Cana airport on time and were able to get on a flight to Dallas and connect on to Phoenix. One of the stresses that occurred was that the hotel that the Delta ticket counter person sent us to was full. When we arrived at the hotel at 11 p.m., the hotel manager said that there were no more rooms available. After more than 30 minutes, they were able to squeeze us all in 1 room, with my daughter sleeping on a cot on the floor. The following morning, the taxi driver (that Delta provided) was a very unsafe driver. We were in the taxi with him for 5 hours. He drove all over the road, cars and buses honking at him, he talked on his cell phone, stopped to buy street food, asked us for gum, and when he dropped us off at the airport he asked us for a tip 3 times. We gave him $10 but he truly scared us the whole trip."

I received an email that their flight was rescheduled to 6/18/23. When my family received their ticket they went to the gate that was printed on their ticket. Come to find out there was a gate change and my family wasn’t told of it. My Mother was treated so badly by delta in Seattle. My Mother told it was her fault for not having the app on her phone. My family got put on stand by and was separated on the plane. For my 4 year old to not be seated next to someone she knows is unacceptable. It took a passenger to speak up and trade seats with my 4 year old to sit next to my Mother. I am absolutely mortified that my family got treated so poorly and told it was all her fault for not having the app. This is 100% the worst customer service and we will never fly delta again."

The flight was confirmed on time throughout the day. Just as we walked into LGA, DELTA canceled the flight. Waiting on Long lines to find out what DELTA will do to get us home. Also on phone, maybe another airport— what about other NYC airports, Newark, Philadelphia, Washington — nothing available. What about flights to any city in Florida and we can drive from there? Nothing? Check the trains, nothing available. Did DELTA have a responsibility to get us home? The airlines answer was NO. Can we take the next available flight to anywhere in Florida? Sure, DELTA tells us that’s in 5 days on Saturday. Hey airlines … we work, we have responsibilities, a life to get home to, our dog… what about that? What about my Medallion status as a loyal customer? No doubt, DELTA airlines stranded us with no options without even an apology. No apology sent to my Delta app, email, nothing! No refund sent to my card either for that matter. In all my decades of air travel, I have never seen anything like this. Delta claims the massive cancellations are due to weather, which they cannot justify on the east coast route. Today still stuck on account of the supposed “bad weather” — there’s no hurricane, tornado or even a thunderstorm. The sun is bright. As of now, we’re driving to Richmond for a flight we found on Jetblue to Fort Lauderdale on Thursday. That’s means 2 days lost just trying to get get home. Our flight to NYC on Sunday was also canceled but DELTA kindly re-routed us and we did finally make it to the wedding albeit late. I’m concluding there is a systemic problem. Something is clearly broken unfortunately. Hopefully our plane Thursday will take off. "

We finally went back to a gate where our luggage was no where to be seen and they offered no refunds or reimbursements and said we were stuck in New York for 4 days with no more flights until Saturday. Horrible staff who were mean and couldn’t answer a single question. Lost a lot of money to them and they handled the situation horribly. Awful experience and now we are stuck in New York because not only are planes fully booked but all car services as well.

My flight to San Francisco wasn’t until 7:40. I had a long wait. Then it was delayed 2 hrs. So around 11pm we boarded the plane. The pilot said due to weather we had to wait inside for clearance. We waited in that hot smelly aircraft for two hours. Every 30 mins he said we would depart. The steward stayed behind the curtain as we all moaned for air due to low air quality on the plane. A few of us mentioned we felt like passing out. Then they brought out hot water. So what seemed like 3 hrs later they cancelled our flight and many flights. So hundreds of people had to stay overnight. Everyone wanted updates and a new flight. They told us no new flights. We waited in hours for phone as service that offered flights the next day. All the airport agents ran off it was too overwhelming. So I stayed the night at the airport on a bench. Canceled work the next day. All the next day I was walking and talking and checking my phone for updates. A few agents were nearby and set up new flights for me. But every time I checked on my flight it was always at a new gate. And my name was never in the system or the flight don’t exist in their system. It was so weird. So going around in circles. Some agents flat out ignored me. I grab lunch at this blue square blue restaurant.  I also ate at this Parisian style breakfast place. Meet a waitress who connected me with the right people to finally get an actual ticket for me out of sfo. So the next day I boarded a plane at 5pm. Again it was another delay. At the end of it the gave me a $15 food card but it was hard to order it online so I didn’t use it.

They put me and my whole family on different flights and made it nearly impossible to get us a hotel that they are “compensating” us for.

The airline and airport were unprepared for this situation so we were forced to deplane several minutes later. Attempting to call customer support did not work due to considerable hold times. With face-to-face customer support (from the gate and the customer support helpdesk) I was informed the plane may not take off for about six hours after the original time (as another aircraft would probably be needed), and thus I switched to a flight about four hours after the original time. However, in actuality there was another craft found and so the delay would only have been two hours. Upon learning this, I went back to the helpdesk and pointed out this information, but they said I could not be put back on the original flight and no refund was possible. The individuals I interacted with were friendly and transparent, but company policies turned what was supposed to be a short flight into a daylong nightmare. Poor quality control and policies relating to customer support have made Delta Airlines more unreliable and inflexible in comparison to similarly priced competitors I have experienced the highs and lows of air travel with."

Bought a first class but the lady at the lounge turned me around asking for a platinum card by American Express or she won’t let me in even tho if i have first class which is why i paid premium fair on top. Never had this kind of experience with any other airline in the past. Will avoid Delta at all costs in the future.

Worst flight we've ever had, and we've flown to 6 continents and over 20 countries on dozens or airlines. The cabin staff was rude and unaccommodating. The food was poor at best, and mostly inedible. They delayed/misplaced one of our check-in bags, the one that had our house keys in it. It was our fault to leave our keys in a checked in bag, trusting the bag would make it to our final destination. But it was almost 24 hours until our bag was returned. We spent the night in a hotel near our house until someone could let us in the next day. Delta is the only airline in my entire history of flying which has lost my luggage .. twice now. They also removed and discarded all of our personal luggage tags. We have no idea why they would do this. Also, on our initial Comfort Plus flight out of the country to London, they cancelled my ticket when I stated I was having a slight allergic reaction to something. This is understandable. But they would not let me fly again without a doctors note stating I could do so. The next day when we tried to book another flight, they charged us an additional $700 each and placed us in the back of Economy. No Comfort Plus seats, which we'd paid for. With the additional $700, this made our tickets $1700 each, one way. Do not fly this airline. It's not worth whatever price savings you may receive."

We arrived to the delta counter so happy to check in our luggage, the agent was so rude and told us that our flight was at 5:30 and left already. We told him about the text and email. He did ignored us and said step to the side and he can’t do anything about it. We went back to the line again to ask what we need to do and another agent was as rude as the first one and no one tried to take responsibility for it. We called West jet and they we’re trying to tell us that our tickets are with Delta reservation number and it’s their responsibility. Long story short Delta didn’t do anything to help us and we lost our two nights hotel ( Thursday night in Toronto and Friday night in Niagara fall and car rental. I think this was scam from delta.

On the afternoon before our 6am flight to MSP and on to HNL, we received a message from Delta that our equipment changed and that on the Minneapolis to Honolulu flight (8 hours) my wife was in a coach seat. After spending hours on the phone we were informed that the only way we could get Delta One seats for both of us was to fly to Detroit, spend the night, and then fly to Honolulu the next morning, thus losing one day in Hawaii of our vacation. We did so and, upon arriving at the check-in in Detroit, there was no Delta One seat for my wife, and she had an 8 hour flight in coach (I would have traded with her, but I am 6'4"": and could not fit in her seat). We finally made it to Hawaii on a very sour note for our anniversary and when we checked in for our return flight my wife was again in coach. After hours on the phone with Delta and Delta Vacations, we were told we both had Delta One tickets but could not confirm until we arrived at the airport. There is no way to call the Delta agent in Honolulu, and Delta reservations has no control over the flight the 24 hours before the flight. We did have Delta One seats when we got to the airport, but not next to each other as I have originally booked 3 months before. After arriving home after the 46th Anniversary trip from hell, thanks to Delta, I filed a complaint and waited for a communication regarding refunding the difference between my wife's Delta One and coach seat. That has been 6 days and I've heard nothing from Delta (I am currently on hold and have been so for an hour). This is the worst customer service I have ever seen. Do not book Delta."

This is their method to rip off costumers. You buy a ticket and then they charge you at the airport for any baggage you have. It's like charging for using the toilet on the plane. It's an industry standard that it's included in transatlantic flights that cost minimum $1000+ for the very basic ticket. Besides that, the food was horrible, small portions and not tasty at all. There were no tablespoon, toothpick, salt and pepper. The trays were dirty and I had to clean them my self. The flight attendants begged us not to ask for headphones or headsets because they had limited amount and not enough for every passenger. There is also a very limited amount of movies and TV shows compared to United. I couldn't find something nice to watch. Bottom line - I'm very disappointed and I will not fly Delta again."

I have flown multiple airlines multiple times, have never seen anything as ridiculous as this. Checkin at LAX: Many rude attendants and supervisors, good for nothing. They are not at all helpful and in fact make the process more cumbersome and time consuming. I was going in the right line but they asked me to use the self checkin kiosk which I didn’t want to but they still just wouldn’t oblige. The kiosk wouldn’t scan my passport for whatever reason. Asked an agent to help. He made a face like I asked him to move a mountain. Without even trying he asked me to go back to “agent assist” which was the original line I wanted to join. Now, that line was huge and it took over 30 minutes for my turn. The Asian guy at the checkin counter was the only positive thing about this process. He was smiling and doing his job with the right attitude. I was not assigned a seat because it was a last minute emergency booking. I stood in the line at the boarding area to get one assigned only to be asked to come back later. 20 minutes later, back in the huge line. Half way through, boarding starts and guess what.. the same employee is responsible to help with that too. No one knew which line to join, what group what not.  Nothing against the employee at the boarding area, but the process in general was the issue. After almost everyone boarded I was finally assigned a seat and allowed to board. "

Delayed bag for over 24 hours New bicycle bag that while saving the bike, was sacrificed with an extreme puncture that broke rivets and reinforcement bars. In one trip, the bag as well over a dozen notable marks and the final blow being fatal. Inability to maintain a schedule due to lack of available pilots. WifI system had been non functional over most of the four flights where it was expected to be. Unnecessary automatic rebooking which had to be reverted due to their inability to maintain a schedule. Delivery service provided to deliver bags unprofessional. Storing customer baggage on personal property when having delivery issues when they had not contacted me for delivery, leave a message in voicemail or text, or email. Bathroom door on A321neo had alignment issues making door closure very difficult. It resulted in myself accidentally opening the door on a woman, to which the flight attended stated it was a user issue. They have not initiated a communications on the process ongoing.

To our surprise, at the time of pre-check in the day before the flight, my husband appears assigned to row 30 of the plane while I appeared in row 18, I think. We decided to arrive at the Boston airport early to try to get seats together and there they tell us that we should try to do it at the boarding desk, we were waiting there until a Delta employee showed up there and with a very bad attitude told us that we had to wait until 3 PM without guarantee to talk about this and he got to talk on the phone for an hour and a half. After 3 PM, he simply left and left me and 4 other people waiting in line because their boarding passes did NOT have assigned seats. We waited and waited and when we saw that the screen said that the boarding process would start in 20 minutes and there was no one there, I went to the desk of the next flight to tell the lady from Delta that there was no one to attend us and the screen It said that the boarding began in 20 minutes. She called on the phone and finally another employee came running and told me that if my husband and I were on the same reservation, she would try to seat us together and she kept both boarging passes. The passengers began to board and I had to remind him that I did not know which group I belonged to because I had 2 assigned seats in very distant rows and it was there that he verbally told me that we would be together in Main Cabin 1. When they called that group, we still did not know what were our seats but in the middle of the row the employee finally printed the tickets that I show in this review. In the middle of the flight, when I went to the bathroom, I saw that all the people who were in line with me waiting to see which seat they were going to be assigned, were sitting in the last rows. The truth is that I do not understand why Delta mistreats its customers like this. I think that everyone, even those of us who pay for cheap tickets, deserve a minimum of respect and consideration."

The SLC flight was repeatedly delayed until it ended up being delayed OVER 12 HOURS! Due maintenance and pilot issues. What is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE is that as compensation for a lost day of vacation, lost day of rental car and lost night of hotel we were offered 8000 Sky miles points for two of us (who are NOT sky miles members). This is the equivalent to approximately $89. Our third person is being offered a $65 credit to be used on a future Delta flight. This is the most ridiculous amount of compensation I can even imagine.

I made sure to buy my ticket in person ($600 one way) over the phone to make sure every requirement was met. Avoid this airline if you are a woman traveling alone, are traveling with a pet or have a fishing vacation and plan to travel with your rod and reel.  Although I bought an ""airline approved pet carrier"" and checked and rechecked dimensions (experienced with a tape measure) I was informed the carrier was too large and I would need to buy one there (unsure of mark up but willing to pay whatever the cost). I was kept at the counter a long time while the agent and her supervisor searched for a carrier to sell me. They were out and told me I would need to book a later flight while they obtained one. This was not an option because my son was already in Utah. I called my daughter back to the airport to take my cat to my ex as she is unable to keep him. Returned to the counter where the supervisor loudly told the ticket agent to find out what I had ""done""with the cat. I checked two bags one being my son's camping gear where the supervisor informed the ticket agent that my sons rod and reel couldn't be in his pack and security would determine if I could carry it with me. It was only a $100 rod but had tremendous sentimental value. Security said it was fine and people take fishing trips with their gear. I made it to the gate (I was over 2 hours early) after it had already boarded and the supervisor met me there to inform me that she herself would not allow me to board with the rod. I put the rod in garbage can (she continued to argue for a later flight while they ""obtained"" another carrier). All together this 4 hour one way economy flight cost me around $1200 and I was made to choose between my son and my best friend of over 8 years. I can't tell you the trauma this has caused me because this woman was desperate for whatever mark up or commission she got from that carrier. I miss my cat all day everyday. You can save a lot of money choosing a different airline and worst case scenario you receive comparable service. This is insignificant but the website asked about food and beverage- the extra money doesn't even get you a full can of coke. They fill multiple glasses from the same can. Insignificant but gross."

I give him a platinum delta american express. He says, oh but this one is only good for when you fly internationally, you need to have a different platinum american express, or you can pay $50 for a lounge access. I ask why I am supposed to present any card at all to access a lounge with a paid first class ticket? He comes back with: ""well, in order to access a lounge you need a first PLUS class ticket"". So this is where I ask: Delta, have you completely lost your mind?! My response is this would be the last time I paid x4 business fair (vs an economy seat) for your not so comfortable domestic business class seat. How many lounge accesses it takes to cover for one idiot willing to pay for a seat that you are giving away at pre-boarding? Do the math"

We booked months in advance and paid a premium so we could select our needed seats. In Atlanta our plane was changed to a larger one at the last minute. We were downgraded and given seats in different cabins. We are seniors and our medical conditions require us to be together when traveling in case of problems. While trying to explain that to the boarding agent she was rude, uncaring, and refused to listen to the issue we were having. Absolutely no effort was taken to try to fix our issue. She asked us to step aside and then after everyone else had boarded she said to take our assigned seats or lose them. Luckily a very kind man sitting next to my wife did hear what we were saying at boarding and offered to switch seats with me. We have not received any compensation nor offer thereof for the downgrade at this time. On the plane flight attendants repeatedly ignored request for something to drink. In SLC I decided to double check our seats that were confirmed just 12 hrs before. Our seats had been sold out from under us. We had no seats on the plane at all.

Connecting in Salt Lake City both ways. Initial flight leaving PDX was substantially delayed so rebooked, same routing. That flight was just a little late, had plenty of time in SLC, no problem. Especially since THAT flight was substantially delayed. Got in to DFW 6 hours later than planned. Return flight, delayed just enough that the only flight to be on time, the last leg, taking me home, was already pushed back when I got to the gate. Delta kindly rebooked me on a flight the next day and of course, no room. Fortunately the gate agent found a seat on a flight later that evening so I only have to wait 5 hours. I assume they used the same computer and data base that Delta Corporate uses, so I am not sure why the company didn't book me there in the first place. Going back a few months, I had a flight get delayed and delayed and then finally they sent me a text that it was delayed until the next morning. Same scenario, no help for accommodations and since they ""delayed"" it, well that's not the same as ""cancelled"" so they have no obligation to help or refund. In that case, I had to be in the destination city before the flight was scheduled to depart so I rented a car and drove all night. I only flew Delta this time because they were a ""preferred airline"" for the corporate travel department I was booking through. I cannot fathom why. Now, the staff at Delta are all very nice, they are as helpful as they can be, but there isn't much they can do when flights are delayed. So thanks to the staff. But your airline sucks. They have posters in the jetway, ""This is what service looks like"". ""This is what happiness looks like"". How about one that says ""This is what on-time looks like""?

Needless to say, her efforts paid off as she found my headphones under a seat three rows in front of me. This is excellent customer service, and they have gained a forever customer. This may seem insignificant to some, but these headphones have sentimental value to me since I am a soldier who travels often, and my wife purchased these for me on our 13th year anniversary. Thank you Laura, and thank you Delta for hiring such a wonderful staff."

163,1,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to Paris,May 2023,1,2,1,,1,,3,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I do not recommend this route. When I purchased the ticket, Delta was partnered with Air France. I fly this route often and when operated by Air France, it was a much better experience. Delta’s LAX to Paris now uses a domestic terminal with no access to duty free or the good airport lounges. We had to use the Delta One Lounge which was the McDonalds of airport lounges. When we boarded the plane they did not offer champagne. They had Sparkling wine.  The business class cabin was mediocre and the the goody bag was kitch environmental rubbish. I enjoy flying International because usually it is luxurious and a highlight of the trip. This was a little better than a long domestic flight which is sad. Won’t make this mistake again! Don’t fly Delta International out of LAX. Delta, stay in your lane and keep to domestic flights. Sub out your international flights to companies that remember what service and class was."
164,4,Boeing 767,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Naples to Atlanta via Paris,May 2023,4,5,4,5,1,4,4,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  My wife and I were returning from a long delayed vacation. We splurged on first class flights. Our flight was supposed to leave Naples, Italy at 0610. Air France sent a heavy aircraft to Naples that had problems getting back out. As a result, we missed our connecting flight in Paris (also an Air France flight) by about 15 minutes. We were rebooked on a Delta flight 5 hours later. When we arrived in Atlanta on Delta flight 085, our checked bags were not on it. We contacted baggage services and they told us the bags were in Paris and would be put on a flight the next day and we would have them by 9 PM. We made it clear that the bags contained prescription medication that we needed. The next day, neither bag showed up, despite repeated attempts to track them using Deltas online system. At 9:15 PM we were told that the bags would be coming in the next day (today). At 1000 today we found one bag loaded onto an Alitalia flight from Naples (they never made it to Paris to begin with), and that it would be transferred to a flight to Atlanta today. The second bag is still in Naples and no one at Delta can do anything to get it moving. They pass it off as the baggage handlers problem not Deltas."

We stayed at the airport an extra 4 hours, made our arrival to Amsterdam later than expected. The wait time and fly connections of the trip is terrible.

166,3,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,baltimore to indi,May 2023,,,,,,,2,0,Not Verified ,"  Worst customer service. They change the flight timing after you book your preferred flight. We booked flight with less lay over time and Delta kept changing the timing so frequently according to their wish and now the lay over is more then other flights. They say you can change the tickets if you like and are not happy with the current flight time change. But all the other flights are so costly and asking me to pay more than 1000$ for flight change. I did not request a flight time change. Delta did and asking me to pay the price difference if I wish to change my flight timing. Me and my kids were traveling together and had one reservation number. I called customer service to see if I can make my kids travel using the unaccompanied minor service. Without even checking if it is possible or not, the customer service agent went ahead and first separated my kids and my reservations. I will never book tickets in Delta ever again. Greedy worst airline it is."
167,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Atlanta,May 2023,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  When boarding the plane in Orlando the woman scanning tickets was very rude and condescending. I have only flown a few times and my parents have never flown. When we got to the front she started pointing at items and saying we needed to consolidate but was rolling her eyes like we should have known that the small monkey stuffed animal my son was holding was considered a bag. I also did not realize my Fanny pack that was only carrying my phone was a bag. She was raising her voice and getting my kids upset. We shoved his stuffed animal and my Fanny pack into a bag and then she said my mothers purse which was smaller than my Fanny pack was a bag then grabbed one of our rolling bags and told the other woman working there to “check it in”. She said “you’ll get it when you get off” then pushed us through. The guy behind us who was on the flight explained since it’s a connecting flight we would pick it up at the turnstile in Albany. It was very stressful and so upsetting to the entire party. The staff onboard were not friendly and the plane was dirty. I was told not to fly Delta but unfortunately the flight was cancelled through the other airline for returning so my choices were very limited. My flight to Orlando was with Jetblue and they had the same written instructions on the website for bags and we did not have any issue with a Fanny pack, a purse and a stuffed monkey being counted in our bags. I would rather drive the 23 hours back home than ever put my family through that nonsense again. The movie screens had to be fixed a couple of times and some passengers still didn’t have a working one. The seats were super uncomfortable. I 100% honestly have never written a bad review for any business but felt it was necessary to share the terrible experience we had with Delta."

169,3,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Atlanta,May 2023,3,3,2,3,2,4,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ,  There was a swarm of bees in one of the airplane's side and the staff of that plane handled the situation poorly. The flight was delayed for almost 5 hours. What's worse is that they changed the boarding gate and we went to that boarding gate in which different flight was scheduled to fly. No announcement over the speaker was made regarding the flight. Then they sent updates via email but it was already too late. No compensations were made. This is such a terrible experience. Might not book with them anymore.
170,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Shanghai,April 2023,2,2,2,2,1,2,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I had the nightmare flight experience from Delta Airlines. My recent trip from Boston to Shanghai was a complete disaster. Delta Airline flight DL509 got delayed 3 hours and made me arrive late in Los Angeles from Boston. This made me miss my connecting flight to Shanghai with China Airlines. Second, Delta Airlines changed my entire trip without notifying me. I found out my flight changed the next day from my travel agent. Delta changed my entire trip and made me use their airline to fly back to China instead of flying with China Airlines. The new trip now forced me to fly to Seattle and then fly to China through Delta Airlines. This forced me to stay in a hotel for 2 nights and the 2nd night hotel I had to pay out of pocket. Third, Delta Airlines then tried to make me purchase a Main Cabin class ticket for the 3rd day flight to China on their Airlines. This was an $800 ticket which they said I have to purchase in in order to get on the only next available flight to China. So, for them making me miss my connecting flight I had to pay $800 just to fly back and also I had to spend $200 the second night for a hotel in Seattle so I can catch the flight to China the 3rd day is ridiculous. Finally, when I took their flight to China on the third day and arrived in China they lost my luggage. I had important items in my luggage which I had to give to my relatives and now its gone and they are still trying to find it. Delta mentioned specifically that I did not need to worry about my luggage when my flight got changed by them. This entire trip made me feel like a helpless homeless person for 3 days and as an old 70 year old man my health deteriorated greatly from the stress they caused me. There’s no shame in the horrendous customer service they provided and I was never compensated by Delta Airlines for the distress they caused me."

172,8,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Sydney to Mexico City via Los Angeles,April 2023,4,5,3,3,1,3,4,1,Not Verified ,"  April 5th we travelled from Sydney to Mexico City and Cabo to Sydney on April 25th, 2023. We booked premium economy after looking at reviews. I've travelled Premium economy with Air Canada once previously. Sydney to LA was very comfortable with the foot rest and ample room. The seats go back far enough for me to sleep quite well. We received a menu and could choose from 2-3 options at dinner and breakfast. There were different wines to choose from as well. Food was great and it was so nice to eat off plates with proper cutlery and not be knocking elbows. The flights from LA to Mexico City and Cabo to LA were also great. What we didn't realise that because we had booked Premium Economy on our main legs we were in comfort class on the shorter flights. More room, designated cabin storage and choice of snacks. So that was a nice surprise. On our return flight from LA to Sydney there was a marked difference in the quality and choice of food and wine. We had a two choices for main one being vegetarian and no choice for breakfast. The dessert was a small slice. I asked for some fruit but none as forthcoming until breakfast. There was only one white wine offered that being Chardonnay which I don't like. Delta advertises wine and food choices for premium economy and did not deliver on the LA to Sydney leg. We did get noise cancelling headphones to use which was good but just be aware you cant use them with your devices only the entertainment provided so you still may want to bring your own. Also internet did not work LA to Sydney but did Sydney to LA. The amenity bags from LA to Sydney included out of date lotions and vouchers. No access to the lounge which United does include in its premium economy offers. Our return flight was changed to a 7 hour wait in LA so it would have been nice to have had lounge access for something that was not our fault. The Sydney to LA flight was late leaving and we had a 2 hour window to collect our bags , recheck them and get to another terminal to catch our flight to Mexico City. Luckily customs was quick but the baggage carousel stopped and needed a maintenance person. It didn't look like we were going to make it. I know Delta would have to book us onto the next available flight if we missed our flight due to no fault of our own but that does create booking problems. As we ran to the gate the boarding closed sign was up but previous passengers had told them we were on our way and we were able to board. Just! There was no allowance or help given by Delta for something they were responsible for. In hindsight a 2 hour time frame does not take into account any delays so a 3 hour window would be much less stressful or stay overnight in LA. Overall the flight was good, especially Sydney to LA. As we have gotten older we have decided to travel in more comfort and Premium Economy does supply that. I'm nearly 6' tall and no longer as resilient to cramped sitting although our run from one terminal to another with full luggage was quite impressive if I do say so myself!"

I booked through an agent in Morocco, was supposed to return in May but the Delta airline (not me, not the travel agent) changed my dates of travel which messed up everything, then they tell me because I didn't book through them specifically they won't do anything about accommodating a different day since I couldn't travel on the day the gave me. How messed up is that, this mega airline is so shameless that just because I didn't book straight through them even when it was them that changed my dates, they won't do anything which totally messes up everything for me, do they care? No! Their attitude is(what they kept saying) you didn't book through us so we can't/won't do anything about it! I will never fly Delta again."

175,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Detroit,April 2023,3,4,1,3,3,3,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Delta canceled our flight home and never notified us via email or text or phone call. They simply rebooked our entire family on separate flights. We originally had a direct flight and now had to have layovers in separate cities to get home. The reason for the cancellation wasn’t weather related rather it was because they are understaffed and didn’t have a crew to man the plane. From what I was told and read online it’s due to Delta forcing the vaccine on their employees and the employees either resigning or are fired. Their choice of compensation was issuing 10,000 miles which is essentially $100. This cancelation forced us to miss Easter with the rest of family. The part that is frustrating is they knew there wasn’t a crew to man the plane and waited until the following morning to rebook everybody and give no notice only a time for check in. Needless to say this sounds like something Southwest or Spirit would do, not Delta."

I walked towards Delta customer service near A15 when in order to find the quickest flight to Dallas. One of the customer service agents found a direct flight with the earliest arrival at 9:19PM. I asked the agent whether they can upgrade my seat for the inconvenience since I payed to insure my ticket. The gentleman sent to a lady and she said she “I upgraded you to Comfort+”. That made me feel good until I scanned my ticket to board and they did not upgrade my seat. "
177,1,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Detroit,April 2023,1,1,1,,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I believe that this will be the last time we fly with this airline. To start, every passenger made it on time but the pilot caused about an hour delay because he didn’t show up and we had to sit and wait after boarding for Delta to find another pilot. If you know the captain isn’t here or running late don’t squish everyone onto your cramped plane. Then I happen to be sitting next to the emergency exit and was trying to make sure I had the procedure of opening the emergency door solely by the illustration in the pamphlet when the delta lady butted into my conversation with my wife to correct me by mentioning the door will open itself after lifting the lever and I would go with it if I was still holding onto it. I jokingly said I guess I’d be the first off. Apparently her sense of humor is poor because then she threatens to move my seat and gets short with me. She said not to be snarky but she takes her job seriously. That’s fine I get taking you job seriously but learn how to communicate better and don’t come across like such a bitch maybe. That FA completely ruined my flight back home with her nasty attitude. I bit my tongue to avoid it coming to a situation like I’ve seen only on social media where police come escort passengers off the plane. After my little run in with the lady in 13d (your employee) I can almost understand how those situations arise. Oh yeah, and they charged us for our luggage for our flight there and our flight back. My wife used her delta American Express and was informed when checking our bags that we shouldn’t have had to pay. Considering all of these issues I’ve had on ONE flight I do believe we will consider other options when it comes to air travel. "

Both flights left on time and all the FA's seemed like they were enjoying their jobs with a smile on their faces. Drinks and snacks were served from SFO-ATL twice on the 4 hour flight. Then on 4-26 and 4-27 going back to SFO, everything went smooth once again. I would highly recommend flying with Delta Airlines. Twice a year I fly these routes and I have never had a problem with one of my flights with Delta. Thanks to the Pilots for getting me to my destination safely and thanks to all the FA's who work hard who keep a smile in their faces. It really makes a difference! Thank you!

179,5,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to West Palm Beach,April 2023,4,5,5,5,5,4,4,1,✅ Trip Verified ," We arrived in Atlanta from London with almost 3 hours to wait. The flight was to leave at 6:15 in the evening but around 530 we were told that there was a weather problem and would be delayed until 7 o’clock. At about 6:55 they change the delayed time to 720 and the plane started to load and was completed by about 730 or 735 and we left the gate headed to the runway. While on the runway we got ready to take-off but then the engines were cut back and we returned to the gate. They said that the weather had closed and they couldn’t take-off , they also said that they had been notified that the pilots time has run out and that they would have to have new pilots so we sat on the plane for about an hour and a half until the new pilot got there. They said they were having problems getting clearance to leave the gate, but by the time they did surprise, the attendant time had run out and now we had to wait another hour while they found new staff. We finally left at about 1030 getting us home at about 1210 where we should’ve been home a little after eight I don’t understand how they couldn’t see the time running out coming for both the pilot and the crew well before it was the time to leave it just seems like poor management. I could understand the weather problem, but the pilots time running out within minutes of taking off doesn’t seem to make much sense and then the attendance time runs out like nobody knew that was coming very very unhappy with that situation. The flight going over to Ireland and the flight back from London to Atlanta Was fine but strictly chaotic once we got to Atlanta."
180,2,A330,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to Frankfurt via Amsterdam,April 2023,1,2,1,3,4,1,2,0,Not Verified ," Their international product is terrible, compared to other European airlines such as Lufthansa, BA or Air France. It’s very difficult to elaborate this in a few sentences since there are many small issues across the full experience that ultimately will impact your body, quality of sleep, mood, etc. Everything from planes condition, served food, utensils, FES, pillows, blankets, lack of basic toiletries (they used to provided in the past), crew’s behavior and attentiveness, quality of seats - all mediocre to poor. A glorified bus ride. What’s more upsetting is the whole “going green” charade to cut cost on elements that are so fundamental to the passenger such as food. They provide meals with this sort of pre-packaged configuration where you get useless wood silverware that makes eating completely difficult. Lack of trays makes eating a super annoying task. The portions are a joke for a 10 hours flight, and breakfast is just replica of the American “beef pockets”. So make no mistake, Delta international economy is no different than Condor or any other budget intercontinental airline that sticks to a schedule. Period. If you really care about a well spacious seat, top service and good food on a long flight, go with a European top airline."

Delta refused to put us up when it stranded us in JFK overnight. They blamed the weather however it was notably clear in both our departure and destination cities and the gate agent couldn't tell us where the inclement weather was alleged to be. I suspect they blamed the weather to avoid compensating a plane full of disgruntled passengers who's travel plans were delayed.

185,1,,Business,Economy Class,Columbus to Tampa via Atlanta,April 2023,3,1,1,5,1,1,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  My flight to Florida April 17th through 21st by Delta was a tremendous disaster. I arrive at Columbus airport and I see that my flight is already delayed by 15 minutes. But as you know how it is, of course it was more than 15 minutes. It was more like 30 minutes delayed. And then there was more delay inside the plane once we were waiting to take off. Those delays landed me in Atlanta well past My time to board my connection flight to Florida which caused me to misconnect. The best they could do was get me book me onto another flight that was taking off two hours later which got me into Tampa at two twenty in the morning. But there's more before that flight even took off. They kept getting the gates wrong for which gate the plane was going to be boarding out of. We literally were playing back-and-forth, back-and-forth from to 2 different Gates. Each time I did this I had to take a train. I took that very train that went between gates A and B four times that night. After getting into Tampa so late I had to book a hotel nobody was going to be able to pick me up. There are no Ubers even running. Now are you ready for the return back? Same thing happened again in Atlanta. I had a misconnect Once again and the plane leaving from Tampa to Atlanta sat on the runway before leaving for 20 some minutes again. And then when we landed in Atlanta it took fifteen minutes to taxi to the gate. I was very concerned that what happened to me coming to Florida was happening again and I told the flight attendant. I'm pretty sure i'm going to miss this flight unless you guys are able to do something she assured me all you have plenty of time and dismissed it like it was nothing. Sure enough I left missed the flight because when I got finally out of there. My connection fight was already boarding and the gate. It was leaving out of was posted incorrect on the telecometer screens. Once again I miss my flight home and thank God it wasn't the last one getting to Columbus that night. I had to book a later flight getting me to clemis at midnight which the person picking me up had to delay their time too. To me this is Outrageous. I will never fly Delta again. Not only did Delta cost me extra money, but they caused me inconvenience, anxiety, panic, time, and also inconvenience to those that were helping me with this trip. And did I mention most of them were rude and didn't even care."

There was a note on my seat, thanking me for being a silver medallion member, and entrusting Delta with my travels. It was such a nice extra touch. I was a little cold, and was wearing my gloves during the flight. Andra noticed (without me even asking) that I was chilly, and she brought over a warm bottle of water for my hands to hold. I was warm the rest of the flight. Andra's professionalism, and the superb way she and her co-flight attendants managed that flight are precisely reasons why I enjoy flying with Delta."

The staff were extremely rude and unprofessional, blaming me for the issue and providing absurd explanations for their inability to resolve the problem, to the extent that the employee at gate B37 had my luggages removed from the plane, closed the gate door in front of me and harshly asked me if had the intention of just be staying at a closing gate or if I’d rather go to the customer service counter to get help. Once I got to the counter, I was told that I had purchased my ticket through Alitalia, which could not be true as the company does exist anymore and turned into a different legal entity and then insinuated that I had firstly purchased a ticket for a different day and then modified the date, which in reality never happened. They even instructed me to contact my travel agency for assistance, as the problem was not on them, which was not helpful at all, as I had booked my ticket through the Italian lastminute.com website months before, since I studied and lived in the US for 3 months, and due to the time zone differences their help desk would have been closed. Regardless booking the ticket through a different website and not directly through the airline, I still received a confirmation number both from lastminute.com and Delta, together with and email from Delta reminding me of the imminent flight and the check-in opening. As far as I understand that system errors might happen, it should not be on the customer to solve such issues, as I own the right to board as long as I have payed, received confirmation, and I am able to check in at the airline counter without problems. Furthermore, it was not imaginable for me that the ticket did not exist according to the boarding system, as it was easily recognised by the check in counter and, once again, I had received confirmation of the booking. To make matters worse, I was forced to wait for two hours at the customer service desk before being booked on the next flight, without even receiving an apology, only 20 minute before the opening of the gate. When I asked confirmation of my luggages being take cared of, or if I needed to checked them in again, I was answered that they would’ve handled it. Unfortunately, my suitcases were not boarded and were gave back to me only three days later. As a result of this experience, I lost a significant amount of time, and I almost missed my connection, since I landed later than expected and had to deal with the opening of the case for the lost luggages, not considering the frustration and stress that the whole situation had caused me."
192,1,,Business,Economy Class,New York JFK to Toronto,April 2023,1,1,,,1,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Flight got delayed and canceled due to the weather, totally understandable. However Delta airline communicates very poorly. Flight schedule update was slow on email, delta app, as well as airport schedule monitor screen. Everything handle so slow and unorganized cause only few front desk service was available for well over 200 people. I waited about 3 hours to get next flight ticket which it should’ve send by email or process by app under account. Customer care desk was not friendly nor patient. I felt poorly treated and disrespected by staff. First time taking a delta and this will be the last time. I’d rather give review for 0/10"

The last 4 flights I've taken with Delta there have been issues. Today's issue: on my delayed flight, when I checked in I chose 32A. When my boarding pass printed it gave me 32B. I brought it to the gate, they said seats are subject to change, i.e. nothing we can do. They have sat me next to the seat I selected. They have no customer service. Everything is a money grab with Delta. Complete garbage. They will go the way of Blockbuster. Bye Delta."

195,7,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Paris via New York JFK,April 2023,3,3,2,3,4,3,3,1,✅ Trip Verified ,"  San Juan to Paris via New York JFK. The experience has been a very good one on the cabin service side, on time departures and luggage delivery. This has been expressed to Delta in most occasions. As a negative result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the service has suffered. On April 4th, the departure gate for the JFK to Paris changed and there was no App notification. After 5 hours wait at the original gate 32, we missed the flight. The Help Desk Agent informed us that our names were called many times for boarding, but at the new gate, where we were not at, obviously. It should have been done on the PA, to be heard everywhere. Delta booked us the next day on Air France, issued new boarding passes, luggage tags and informed that the four suitcases would be transferred to arrive on the flight with us. Upon arrival, a day later in Paris, the suitcases were missing. Two hours later the claim was processed through Air France and arrived 6 days later in terrible state, delivered by Chronopost. Fortunately, we traveled for a long stay. Tourists staying for only a week in Paris would have been very inconvenienced. The departure gate change was advised by email, not on the App. Supposedly the App does not have the interface. This seems hard to believe… being a very important issue. We encourage Delta to try harder."

I fly for business. The agent was completely uncaring and rude. I had a procedure on my foot the day prior to my 5:30am flight. Didn’t get a wheelchair which was (obviously) a mistake on my part. Because at 5:00am there was a huge line at TSA. I asked the TSA there about getting one, but that meant starting the process all over again by leaving the TSA line and going back up front. As it turned out, TSA opened another line and the process sped up. I hobbled to Gate 5 (at exactly 5:20) where the agent never looked up and said (and I quote) What’s your last name? & Gate 7. I hobbled over there and saw that wasn’t my flight, so I hobbled back  to Gate 5, where the agent was just wrapping up and getting ready to leave that area. I told him that’s not my flight and while I’m talking, he’s doing his work thing and moving to his next Gate. He has an accent so it was a little difficult to understand him, but what made it worse was that he now has his back to me and walking away. I have to say to him, “Dude, don’t make me chase after you in this”! Pointing to my boot. That’s when he told me, the flight took off already. It was 5:24 when he said this words and kept moving.  When I got to Gate 7 (new gate) the same agent was there (I guess he went the long way around or something, and recommended that I should have got a wheelchair! He was just a wry rude and inconsiderate human who should not be the first representative that Delta Clients have to speak with. Delta, you can have a better person as your initial contact."

They charged me twice for the unaccompanied minor fee going one way. I continuously have to call them back for support and corrections and their airline customer service reps are rude, the first time I called the lady kept repeating ""Thank you for calling How may I help"" so I thought she couldn't hear me so I kept saying ""Can you hear me?"" and she kept repeating ""Thank you for calling How may I help"" so I asked ""Can you hear me?"" it was ridiculous then she said yes I heard you the whole time, so why didn't she answer my question why did she repeat her greeting? Although I had reached the right department she transferred me without reason. I had to call back the inquire about the double charge, the new rep asked if I saw a number that starts with 006 as I replied ""Yes"" she started ""I am just asking questions to try to help"" and I ignored that ignorant mess and continued by saying ""Yes, there are 2 numbers here that start with 006"" and I read them both to her. These people are impatient with bad attitudes, as I type this message I am on hold. I have been placed on hold by this rep for a majority of the phone call. The last time I flew Delta the back of the aircraft reeked or Urine. Other airlines have been far smoother to deal with."

200,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Malaga via Boston / Amsterdam,March 2023,4,2,2,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Flying Delta has been the most frustrating experience in my 25 years of flying (and I am not an airplane snob) - I fly Spirit and never had a problem. For Delta however things are very different. The methodology used to assign sits at the loading (not check in) desk in incredibly confusing, unnecessarily painful and it should be downright illegal. I have travelled with many companies and not even lowest cost company does something so horrible. I was on the chat and phone and willing to pay for a seat and nobody was able to help me. Horrible system. Also the day of my flight the check in desk agent showed up at the time when the airplane was supposed to take off after somebody that was super nice called her and also helped her. We only manage to learn that one of the stewardesses did not show up for work that day. She eventually came 45 minutes late and we departed one hour and 5 minutes later than schedule. I had 1 hour and 29 minutes before my next flight prior to this delay. It was the grace of God and the great people of Boston that let me jump the line and after running and sweating like I was in a sauna I made it 5 min before the gate closed. Nightmare experience - never to be repeated again. The lady at Delta that open the door in Boston barely acknowledge my issue with 25 min to my next international flight and gave me the wrong directions to a bus that was closed for the day 30 min prior to the plane landing. Unprofessional and extremely rude and uninterested in my travel. I had 2 international connections booked with Delta for KLM flights and Delta did not care to even acknowledge anything about those flights. No tickets were issues - as if I would have bought them on my own. Extremely frustrating. This was by far the worse flying experience I had in all my years of flying companies from China to India and Europe to South America. I have never been treated with such disinterest and dishonesty especially considering the price of the ticket. I also have stock in Delta which I plan to sell promptly since if my experience is any proof there will be very few people flying Delta in the future."

We had to reschedule for a flight 5 hours later. That change cost $269 which was $52 more than the round trip ticket. So the round trip ticket was close to $500 vs $217 with a middle seat instead of the aisle for the original flight. Not to mention extra parking and food while we waited. Price gauging at its finest.

No way to reach customer service. After wasting hours waiting for an agent, I requested a refund and booked with another airline. I received only a partial refund that did not cover the expense of rebooking. Upon arrival at the airport, I learned the flight was never canceled, but I was canceled.

I stood in line for 3 hours and 30 minutes, I then get to the desk. The supervisor closes it due to time and says there is nothing they can do ... okay so now it's 2:30 am no hotel and blizzard conditions so I camp out at the airport. Get rescheduled for 9:50 pm the next day, they cancel the 10 am flight for unknown reasons. I was there all morning and saw planes take off. Now they delayed my plane 3 more hours after making me wait 24 hours. Weather related? Nope clear skies today. I feel like I am captive to this company and I just want them to send me home. Why wouldn't they try to send me home in a reasonable time frame? No idea. Worst experience. Never flying Delta again.

I understand the part where my flight got delayed due to weather. But I reached out to the support chat for getting my boarding pass which I couldn’t get online for some reason. I couldn’t call then since it was a long wait on call support. They responded after 3 hrs, which is again fine by me, i asked them to get me a boarding pass for 2:20 pm flight. They told me it was cancelled. I asked them multiple times if they meant the flight was cancelled or the ticket got canceled they kept saying the flight was cancelled. Now I had to accept obviously even though I couldn’t see anything on the internet about that. They gave me the boarding pass for 6:55 pm flight though and quickly removed my previous flight from my profile which i could see before the chat. I now saw that the 2:20 pm flight has departed and it was not cancelled at all. I have the evidence that i was booked on that flight in screenshots, but i never got the ticket which is what i was asking the support for. I was also assigned a seat. Even though they put me in first class seat for my 6:55 flight, i wanted to reach my destination earlier. And it’s not fair to lie to your customers, when they really trust you and reach out for support."

I sat in the flight on the runway for 3 hours without takeoff, before it was returned to the same gate (due to weather conditions, so not Delta's fault). 12:00 am: Then, there was an announcement made by Delta to go to helpdesk for next steps. 2: 30 am: After a 2 hour line at the helpdesk, I was told that they can't help with international flights, and I should call customer service. Customer service has a wait time of 1.5 hours 4 am: I connect to customer service. After taking my information and everything, the person asks to transfer me to another team, with a wait time of 30 mins 4:30 am: The new person just repeats what I had already shared and without asking transfers me to another team. The wait time is 1.5 hours. Next morning: 10 am: Wait time is 2 hours. 12 pm: We are experiencing delays. If you'd want to continue, new wait time is 1.5 hours more. So, after spending an entire night (last 8 hours) trying to reschedule a flight that was canceled by Delta, I still couldn't get even a booking done! Next day, the poor service continues! One of the worst possible services!"

I was on flight 1899 coming from Montego Bay and what we endure on March 26 2023 into March 27 2023 to receive just $179 in credit is a slap in the face for your customers. No money will repay what we went through for close to 24 hours of pain and suffering. The flight crew left us stranded at Atlanta airport with no guidance or reliable information. There were no Delta staff to help us or had any knowledge that the flight crew left us in Atlanta. We spent hours waiting and figuring out on our own, where our luggage was to go through customs and hopefully return to Boston. When we overcome one obstacle more was yet to come. We walked all over the airport, we were hungry, with no food or water for hours in. Kids and elderly sleeping on the cold floor. No one from Delta in sight to help us with any need. This was unacceptable and inhumane. To top this Delta is now playing games about with refunds and responding to customers emails."

Returning home to Raleigh was dicier two days later — they texted me saying my flight was delayed twice, which led me having to rebook for a later flight (which was irritating to say the least). At least that one wasn’t delayed going to Atlanta but thanks to storms my connecting flight to Raleigh was delayed 30 minutes. Inbound to ATL was an older 757, while the quick hop to LEX was a former AirTran 717 (and the reverse heading back). Folks, if you fly Delta, fly a nonstop if you can.

When we arrived, we were directed to a gate across the airport just to get any information. But they didn't have any! Eventually they got us another flight scheduled for 3 hours after we landed, but then even that one was delayed several times. I missed my connector with another airline and Delta's answer was ""not our problem. We got you to your destination."" Luckily United was understanding, but I was still delayed over 24 hours. Actually as I'm writing this, I'm still stuck in Nashville. Anyway, the weather today was actually quite nice, so the only reason I can think of for this many delays is straight up incompetence, originating in Atlanta and reverberating through their counters in Nashville.

227,2,,Business,First Class,Los Angeles to Myrtle Beach,December 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ,"  I have been a member of their frequent flyer program for 22 years. I have purchased first class tickets and have never asked for an upgrade. In 2021 I flew Delta so much that I achieved Platinum Status for 2022. Delta’s Platinum status provides a number of regional upgrades as a reward for flying so much over the course of a year. In July I knew what my travel schedule would be for the remainder of the year so I purchased tickets to travel for September, November and my annual Christmas trip home. I used the certificates to purchase first class seats for my travel dates. Then on the day of my Christmas travel I printed out my first-class tickets and boarding passes for the trip. I reached out to Delta to confirm my seats. At that point I was told that I needed one more pass to have first class seats for my round trip travel. I was told the young lady that I purchased the tickets in June and I have my tickets showing my travel in first class and my seat assignments for the round trip. I was passed along from agent to agent and finally I was told that the agent who booked the trip made a mistake and I would either have to pay $1,100 or 150,000 air miles to use the ticket that I had printed out. I was outraged to say the least. Even though I was told by every agent that I spoke with that it was Delta’s mistake and not mine. Reluctantly, I agreed to their demands and completed my trip however this episode left a really bad taste in my mouth and tarnished my opinion of Delta Airlines. For years I could have been flying US Air and landing in Florence which is closer to my family. However, I remained loyal to Delta because I liked their service. And I guess that is my fault because loyalty these days mean absolutely nothing these days."

Delta usually overlooked their flights causing delays as they beg people to switch flights/travel plans. Today, we boarded our flight and still did not leave for 90 minutes later. The flight is a total of 90 minutes! This is so far the worst experience I’ve had with Delta. They are quick to not spite you to board if past boarding time but this extraordinary wait for no reason is unbelievable. An hours ago they said it was the water and we just would not have coffee. Here we are still here! This screams overbooking or poor scheduling if we should be at our destination already and so haven’t left! "

I had a connecting flight to Boston that I missed due to the delay but they rebooked me on a new flight at the gate with no charge and no hesitation. I was satisfied with the level of customer service I received. When we landed in LaGuardia, Delta put my bags on the flight I was supposed to be on originally to Boston, so my bags got there before I did, which I was happy about. On the flight to Boston, I got a whole row to myself, and the pilots were very informative and very professional upon landing the plane in bad weather. The whole experience was great."

I had another fly from Lima to Chile Santiago at 9am est. Delta representative said they can rebook me without any fees unless is greater than 24hrs he told me to read the agreement. They can do whatever they want because there is no other airline available at this time. I will never fly with them again, worst part is I called them and they told me my fly is scheduled to arrive at 4:25pm so I bought another ticket from Lima to Chile at 6:25 pm - guess what, at the counter I was told that it was a mistake and that I m supposed to arrive at 4:25am to Miami and from there to lima at 10:45pm - this is corporate evil at its max.

Delta offered me an unacceptable alternative – to return March 6, 2023. I had to get back March 5 – and incurred a 1500 dollar expense and major inconvenience to do so, additionally I had to be picked up in Detroit (at 11:30 PM) and driven back to Lansing as the DTW to Lansing flight was missed; I received an email from customer care requesting I submit receipts for costs incurred in Delta cancelling my flight – which I did this AM. They offered to reimburse me 57 dollars. Additionally in communication with the customer care rep I was admonished for emailing and asking to have this escalated to someone who could make a decision on reimbursement. First off, If the costs were not reimbursable then whey did they request I sent receipts in for them in? Second it the original person who is ""customer care"" is not helpful there is no opportunity to escalate to someone more senior. If find this to be totally unacceptable and not what I'm used to with Delta"

I have never experience a more unprofessional experience when flying. I understand that the employees deal with all types of people but at my gate check, after I had been bumped from my flight (10-15 mins post boarding start) and the attendant then tell me ""you have the wrong time"" and proceed to tell me that I can board if someone is missing only AFTER the standby people (which she confirmed were not bumped from the flight). Then customer service told me all they could do was provide $25. No worries Delta will not be planning a trip voluntarily with this airline."

I had to change plane tickets earlier that morning due to a late arriving plane from another Delta Affiliated airline. I was traveling with 3 people and we could not get three seat side by side. Once we arrive in SLC I discussed the matter with the Gate Attendant and they were able to help us and make sure we all traveled together. I am really appreciative of such a professional and accommodating staff.

Lauderdale on February 19th and was scheduled to return to Toronto on February 22 via Atlanta. That day Toronto was set to experience a snowstorm so I contacted Delta to inquire as to the status of my flight. I was put on hold and greeted by a sympathetic agent who could not help me. She immediately transferred me to a more senior agent who was very helpful, re-booking my flight for February 24 via La Guardia. On February 24 as we were about to board our flight we were told the flight would be delayed due to high winds in New York. I approached the agent for assistance as this delay would cause me to miss my connector flight to Toronto. She gave me the option to wait for further information and hope to get on a later flight standby or re-book another flight. Unfortunately, due to it being the Spring Break week, all flights were sold out and overbooked however she kept trying and eventually was able to offer me a flight at another airport February 26th. Again, I rebooked. On February 26th the scene at the airport was one of chaos due to holiday travel. The agents were most helpful and accommodating. On my flight from Atlanta to Toronto, again the flight crews and desk agents were so helpful and accommodating. I felt appreciated to be their customer and I felt they listened and wanted to help me! I want to thank Delta for their amazing customer service!"

236,1,Boeing 757,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Ft Lauderdale,February 2023,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Original departure time was 10:05am. when I arrived 2 hours early, the plane had too much fuel on board, so after an hour or so they had to send a truck to empty some fuel. the truck they sent was full, so had to wait another hour or so for a new truck to come get some fuel out. We had boarded the plane, by that time, a crew member timed out. We were de-boarded because ""Delta cant have you on the plane for 3 hours (probably because they'd have to refund us at that time) and we were told ""there is another crew member on standby at the lounge. They should be here in about 10 minutes"" - an hour later, still no crew member. By the time the replacement crew member got to us, a pilot had to be replaced due to their time being up as well. Another hour or so later, another plane pulled up to the next gate and we inherited their crew and pilots. Finally boarded again, and after 30 min on the tarmack, were told the plane needed fuel so we were waiting for a fuel truck. An hour later we were waiting on a fuel slip after the truck was done and we were good to depart. Absolutely ridiculous experience. I paid almost $1000 for this trip and specifically chose delta because this experience isn't typical to them. In hindsight, i should have flown another airline. I probably would have had a similar experience with Spirit, but it would have only cost me half of what delta did.  One more addition. My return flight was delayed due to ""mechanical issue"" which was later described in an email from delta as ""damage to the aircraft"" - on that flight customers were offered $800 to switch to a later flight. I paid $1000, for that trip, and delta refused to refund any more than $140. After my email response, i was told any more communication about this issue would be pointless."
237,2,,Couple Leisure,First Class,Cleveland to Maui,February 2023,5,5,5,5,1,2,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," My wife and I flew First Class and Delta One flights from Cleveland, Ohio to Maui and back and had the following problems and delays on our flights. The first issue was on February 18, 2023 with our Delta One flight from Atlanta when we had to sit on the plane for over an hour because of some unknown maintenance issues before taking off late. Once we landed at Kahului, HI airport we sat on the tarmac for two hours before pulling up to the gate to unload. We were told by the pilot the reason was we had such a strong tailwind arriving early (not the case) along with many planes ahead of us that needed unloaded too. Thus, everyone had to sit on this plane for over 13 hours! On February 25, 2023 on our return Flight from Maui, HI we boarded the plane 1.5 hours later than scheduled because our plane had been sitting out on the tarmac for some reason waiting to pull up the the gate delaying our take-off by this long. When we boarded our Flight in Atlanta to return to Cleveland we sat in the plane for 1.5 hours being told by the pilot there were maintenance issues and ultimately had to add more fuel to the plane and waiting for the fuel truck to arrive with no estimated time being provided by anyone. All of these delays seem to be preventable by improvements in customer service i.e., better communications and your maintenance practices such as fuelling planes needs improved. These flights were a very disappointing experience. Then we are offered a $75 voucher eCredit, which is not useful. No interested in flying Delta after all these issues."

My flight was cancelled without any prior notice, and when I called their customer service line, I was on hold for hours. When I finally spoke to a representative, they were unhelpful and gave me no information about my options for rebooking my flight. The lack of communication from Delta Airlines was extremely frustrating. I had to spend hours trying to find out what was going on with my flight, and even then, I received no clear answers. To make matters worse, Delta Airlines' customer service was incredibly unhelpful. The representatives I spoke with were rude and dismissive, offering no assistance in rebooking my flight or providing any sort of compensation for the inconvenience. Overall, I would never recommend Delta Airlines to anyone. Their lack of communication and terrible customer service made for an incredibly frustrating and disappointing experience. If you value your time and sanity, I suggest looking elsewhere for your travel needs."

After discussing with flight attendant, I  let them take my bag. I went to my seat 34, my over head bin completely empty as were multiple others bins. This is very frustrating and should not occur."

Delta mad it very difficult to communicate with a real agent and and after calling 2-3 numbers, being on hold for over 15 minutes and starting a couple of chats we were forced to purchase 2 tickets at over $2,600 each. We were told at the airport that upon return, we could reach out to Delta to get the ""bereavement"" discount. After the dramatic experience and trip, we tried, in vain, to communicate with Delta to get the bereavement discount. After wasting even ore time completing customer service forms, talking to Delta people, chats, etc. we were told ""no"", bereavement fees were similar to what we paid, really? We fly to Europe every few months and we never paid over $1,600 on any flight particularly on economy. We believe Delta took advantage of our vulnerable situation knowing that because of our mother's sudden death, we have to travel regardless of cost. Another family member traveled with a different airline and they got bereavement fees and their trip was significantly less than ours."

We wanted to take an earlier flight to avoid the storm today but they wanted to charge $1200 per ticket!

Additional costs were incurred due to this. The Delta's staff offered no vouchers for food, hotels or anything. Boarding the flight the next day, the new on flight staff apologized for the system issues and flight being rescheduled. They also advised us to contact Delta for compensation. Some flyers had already received refunds, vouchers and sky miles. I just received communication on 2/7/23 for my 9/12/22 advising me Delta does not compensate for weather conditions.

Both times flying we had our baby stroller and car seat checked in. Upon receiving our stroller, the wheel was cracked, as well as the seat was completely snapped. This is an incredibly expensive and well built stroller. It was mishandled in a very inappropriate way. We reached out to the airline a day late per their 7 day policy, we understood completely that we did that, the reasoning was simple, we were in a strange country with no signal and had to figure out what to do. Delta took about 3 days to tell us what to do, that gave us 3 days to handle it and acquire signal, with a baby adjusting to a new country. My wife has been a member of delta for over 6 years and swears by them, she only flies delta. Our claim was initiated and we were very polite to communicate. This was Deltas head baggage control managers response. He said that we aren't at all going to issue anything. He left us with a delta $100 travel voucher. He was rude, he never replied to the email that we sent back begging to help us and understand that we were a day late on our claim. We need a stroller, that's what our baby needs, Delta broke it and they aren't taking any responsibility."

They are the face of Delta - not just cabin crew! I arrive at SKY priority - no ‘hello, no how is your day’, just notices an old luggage tag and asks me to remove it and put it on the bin. Fair enough I thought, my fault. I either forget or simply the tags are nearly glued on and just wait for use their scissors. I regularly fly top tier with other delta compatible / SKY team airlines. So, I ask if I can use delta lounge. The answer is no. I ask to double check but get told to ask lounge staff instead - Who later said yes. Isn’t this on the computer? No goodbye. “Security is over there”, no smile - not once. I get that they do the same thing countless times each day, but isn’t it their job to greet people? Do I need to tip for giving my suitcase to get a fake smile? Come on Delta. A smile really makes it appear that you pretend to care. Sadly, the checkin experience downgraded to 3. Cabin staff much better, on most occasions."

Our bags only showed up 3 days later. I filed a claimed and Delta thinks the $500 voucher is compensation enough.

The day before this flight, I received a notice that the airplane would be changed, but there was no mention of the need to get a new seat assignment. When I checked in via phone, I received confirmation of checking in, but no indication of the need to choose a seat. When I arrived at the airport, I was shocked to discover that I no longer had a seat on the plan. After a long conversation with a very unhelpful and unsympathetic agent, he assigned me to a window seat in the very back of the plane. The plane was dirty, smelly, and only one of the video screens in our row actually worked, which made even more people angry. My daughter and grandson were told they didn't have seats on the plane at all and had to wait until the whole plane was loaded to be placed in random seats, so our party could not sit together. I am exceptionally disappointed in how I was treated. I purchased a seat, but for some reason, my purchase was not honored."

The hard products are fantastic, such as the free inflight wifi I am using to write this review now at 35000 feet. My international leg from Tokyo to Detroit was decent-comfortable comfort plus seat, entertainment and amenities. The crew aboard was an older team, hence just went through the motions without much personal touch. The meals on the international leg left a lot to be desired as it lacked quantity and substance. I was hungry. My second leg was nice too. Crew were very friendly, present and eager to provide customer service. Enjoyed the abundance of free snacks and drink rounds. I loved the Delta beer that is unique to only Delta. Overall, Delta has the ball on its operation and I appreciate all the investments they are making, which makes their service fairly consistent."

Check in at El Dorado was a breeze and people who work for Delta at the airport were quite nice. As usual I try to board the plane last if I fly economy in case there is an empty row and to my surprise half the flight was full so rather than sitting next to someone the lead flight attendant said I could sit anywhere and I sat behind the exit row. Prior to take off one of the crew members was quite rude to a Spanish speaking customer, made a comment about how he needed to learn English and kept on complaining to his co-worker how tired he was and this and that. Definitely not professional, and non the less rude especially considering you’re on a flight from Latin America to the United States. Every seat had a blanket and pillow, prior to take off we were provided with hand sanitizer, a small amenity kit with ear plugs and an eye mask and headphones. After take off drinks and a small snack consisting of a cold pastry with chicken, fruit and a chocolate were given out along with drinks including alcoholic beverages. In the back galley there were snacks for anyone who wasn’t asleep on this red eye. Aside from that crew member everyone else was very professional and nice as usual. There’s a good selection of movies and music but nothing had changed from what they had the month before when I flew to Bogota. Overall I would say 8/10."

There were no hotels available in the area and no rental cars available. Delta offered no assistance whatsoever. No compensation, not even a food voucher. We had to sleep in the airport which was scary to say the least. This was two days ago and we have yet to see any sort of apology or compensation for our terrible experience. They just left us stranded for a whole night. They would not even give us our luggage when we were trying to find a rental car. To get from Las Vegas back to PCB took a day and a half.

My daughter was able to change the itinerary so that I could still make it before midnight, but it involved me now flying 4 flights rather than 2. Again, the 3rd flight was delayed causing me to miss my connecting flight by 10-15 minutes again, and again Delta was unwilling to hold the plane. Because of this, I was forced to stay in Atlanta overnight by myself instead of spending the holiday with my family. I reached out to Delta's customer service requesting a refund but they would only offer a $100 travel voucher (mind you, my ticket was about $260 initially) as the itinerary was already flown (despite the fact that the only reason I flew the itinerary is because I was not allowed off my plane in Buffalo). I requested numerous times to be escalated to a supervisor but the Delta customer service rep refused, and then responded saying she would no longer respond to my correspondence. I have now been left with no choice but to file complaints with the BBB and DOT. Needless to say, neither myself nor my family will ever be flying with Delta again, and I would advise to anyone I know the same."

The stress they put you through definitely is not worth the price. Wouldn’t go through it even if I was being paid for. Catching an early morning itself is stressful enough but Delta just had to make it tougher. I woke up at 3 AM just to find out that my seat had been changed after check in. The lady who handled our baggage failed to mention that to us, the lady who assisted us before boarding promised it will be changed when boarding, have to say not surprised when she couldn’t keep her promise that was made by her own self only minutes ago. Was told to have the cabin attendant assist us but even she was not willing to either. It was if Delta was playing the blame game amongst their own crew which proves how insufficient their service is and how unprofessional they are. Would’ve expected a company so big to have a clear understanding of where responsibility stands in certain cases but now we know that doesn’t apply for them. Don’t let Delta ruin your trip because it’s definitely not worth it. Writing this before take off so let’s all hope we at least get to the destination safe."

Delayed an hour from departure due to 1 missing passenger then had to de ice so we were already behind schedule. The pilot let us know after we were all seated that the second in command was going to be flying. Take off was a bit rough but landing was okay. Once we landed we waited from 8:30 to 10:30 in the plane for a gate . 2 FKN hours. Finally got to baggage pickup and our luggage was in the plane for almost 3 hours after letting us off the plane. Spent hours 2-3 in the baggage services room waiting for an update on our luggage.

No worries about a carry on and it’s size, no headaches when delays are communicated, ability to charge your electronic devices on flights, free snacks and drinks, and comfortable planes. Our flight the other day was stuck on the tarmac for 3+ hours and the airline credited us for our negative experience unprompted and made it right. Blown away by the customer service. Every other airline is just headache after headache after headache with absolutely no reprieve or compensation and it’s just not worth the money in comparison.

I had to call constantly and with no updates or help I had to track down the bag myself by calling everywhere, somehow it ended up with American Airlines. The staff at American was friendly and helpful and offered to get the bag to Delta. I could not contact anyone at Delta to accept the bag and calling their ""customer service "" line is useless. Tooke two more days and countless calls to get my bag correctly sent to me then another day to get them to deliver it.

I am 19 year old, first time travelling alone from College to home (Boston to Portland). Delta cancelled my flight 5 hrs ahead and rebooked me for the next day. Then just about to fly to first leg, they cancelled my 2nd leg flight. At MSP I pleaded to the agents at the Airport and finally got a flight for SEA. I reached 5pm PST in Seattle (after so many cancelations). My next flight to final destination (PDX) was 7.56pm. They kept delaying the flight to 1.45am and finally announced that flight ws canceled. Really. They did not book me to any flight and did not offer any hotel. What do I do at the airport. My parent immediately booked a ticket for the next available flight at 7.30am for a premium price of ~ $520. (A flight which usually cost under $100). Early morning when I reached to the counter to see if I can use my original last leg so I do not have to pay double. I was told they cant do any thing even though my original ticket was to PDX. Desperate to go home first time after 1st semester of my college I boarded the flight on my new ticket and saw empty seats. It is just ridiculous when airlines try to make money and not care about customers. My parents have to shelve out $520 just to fly me from SEA to PDX even though I already had a ticket up to PDX. What a shame! I have spent more then 10 hrs and their customer service is just going in circles and not willing to help. I hope Delta would listen to this feedback. I am not going to fly Delta any more and do not recommend."

We asked why it was not recognized that we were on a DL connecting flight and provided a meager 5 - 10 min, which would have been the original scheduled departure. Answer was they would get in trouble if they caused the flight to be Late. Simply very disappointing and surprised that Delta is operating this way. Our arrival destination of CRW is not a hub. Waiting 5 - 10 min on connecting flight departing Early? for a family of 4 would not have affected anyone’s schedule.

276,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Denver,December 2022,1,3,1,3,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ,"  I never had good experience with this Airline, but my last two experiences are the whole new level. In summer of 2022 I was booking flights back from Europe for my family and they double charged me for same flights and took them 3 weeks to refund the money. In December they canceled our flights to Colorado last-minute two days in a row, and would not rebook us until well half way into our vacation. Insultingly they tried to offer us a layover flight in Los Angeles, on day 4 and even that without a guarantee that would make our direct flight I paid more for, an 8 hour travel. We spent two days including Christmas Eve trying to get a resolution with customer service (if you can call it that). We lost all the money we paid for our stay in Colorado, and ended up staying in Atlanta for the holidays with no plans, and no vacation days left. My emotions aside, this company simply does not feel the need to care for their passengers. Our well being and experience simply takes the backseat, and their frontline people hide behind the process and simply shrug it off. We are simply cargo to them, and cargo can be shuffled around and delayed with no consequences. They surely do not live up to their tone-deaf advertisements they make us watch prior to takeoff. What grinds my gears even more is that they will make you move a pound of language from one bag and right into another because of 'weight limit'. Defies all logic. All bags - by weight and volume still ends up on the same plane. Why would a company have processes in place to add to the passenger frustration, and intentionally not do anything about it. They fully capable to provide everyone care, but they make conscious effort to not do that. They ask us to complete surveys, and I'm sure they get plenty of feedback like this, but they simply chose to not do anything about it. What a shame."

I end up missing my flight but what is worst is, after Delta told us they will provide transportation to the cruise, they left stranded on our own. When we finally got to the Shipping Port, the ship had already left. Now, in December as I write this review I am at JFK again since 4:00am this morning. When I left home my flight was schedule to arrive on time. By the time I got to the airport, the flight is cancel. It is now 11:25am and Delta representatives has given me the push around all morning except for one young who has been trying his best to help us. We call the Delta line about twenty times and when we do got somebody they put us on hold for four hours. My son who’s birthday we are celebrating is still waiting for someone from Delta’s headquarters to answer the phone. Mind you we are holding for four hours now and I am not exaggerating. We just cannot delete with the continual push around so we endeavor to stay online no matter how long they have us to wait. Our family friends who is celebrating twenty seven years of marriage has already miss much of their activities for their celebration. We are now trying to get to San Juan because we cannot connect with the ship in Orlando anymore, so we have to connect in San Juan and we are still having the run around. No one has even come to us to offer some sought of comfort. There’s one young who has been doing whatever he can but he still needs his supervisors approval and he is having the round around as well. Delta is a disappointment and a public disgrace. No one should ever flight with this airline again. I am so terribly disappointed. "

I have over $800 of gifts, clothes, and belongings in that bag. I have no clothes, toiletries, or gifts for Christmas. I talked to the representative in Cleveland at the Delta baggage claim. They told me the bag would arrive an hour later that night and it would be delivered after. Then the man at the desk calls me 20 min after I left the airport and tells me it’s actually going to arrive the following night at 10 pm. That flight gets canceled and I am told it is going to arrive the next day. That flight also gets canceled. I call delta and try to get a timeframe for delivery and the representative hangs up on me. Then I call again and tell them to reroute the bag to Norfolk, Virginia where I’m spending Christmas with my family. I texted the rep again using the Delta texting service to ensure it was going there. They said it was going to ORF airport and that there was no update in the system yet. I woke up today Sat Dec 24th to find out my bag is now going from ATL-CLE on DL 1355 even though I specifically instructed Delta two times over the phone and text service to deliver it to Norfolk, Virginia. Now I’m leaving for my trip to Norfolk, VA and I don’t think my bag is going to get delivered on time. I am without gifts, clothes, and all other belongings and Delta has ruined the holidays for me.

I’m assuming the people on the grounds are also working as hard as they can. But you as a company suck. You have over-extended yourself and make promises to customers that you never follow through with and you believe that your vouchers and your credits will make it better. I don’t travel a ton. In fact, maybe once a year, but I am seasoned. I have never flown Delta until this time to Hawaii from Denver. I have never been so disappointed in my life. Delta behaved like it never knew any type of weather existed or knowledge of the workings of an airport. I understand there are always going to be limitations. I have been through delays but nothing like this. My first delay from this trip was due to weather from another city - fine. But it was delayed even further because when we were got to Seattle, there wasn’t a loading bridge that could unload us from the airplane - it was coming from the S gate to the A gate and the pilot didn’t know why. We missed our flight to Hawaii by 10 minutes and couldn’t get one until the next day. If you don’t have the workers/materials or have the workings of the flight even if delayed planned out, don’t make these promises that you can get us there. Do your due diligence and make sure things are running smoothly at the airports you do business at. The next day when we flew out of Seattle to Hawaii - they had to taxi us back due to mechanical issues. After about 45 minutes, I thanked the mechanics after they departed and we were off. Better safe than sorry for this delay. And now that I’m thinking about it, this was Hawaiian airlines. I do have to say when we did land in Hawaii that day, the luggage people at Delta went way beyond my expectations! It was waiting at their customer service office. Coming home from the LA airport was also a terrible experience. We were of course delayed (no reason given) which was fine but when we were all boarded, we were having issues with the push off tug and we were delayed another hour because we had to wait for another one then when we finally made it to Denver at around 11:30, we had to sit on the plane for two hours with really no true explanation as to why. There were two planes that passed us by & they both went to their unloading gate. I understand weather, I understand shortages of workers but Delta acted as if does not. Don’t offer flights if you can’t follow through to just attempt to get us to the gate in a timely manner. Again the employees were top notch except for your customer service via chat - they couldn’t do nearly as much as when we waited in line for two hours to talk to a human which I’ll never understand why either - my questions were the same. Bottom line, Delta don’t make promises to your customers you never planned to keep. And give all your employees raises for dealing with your crap!"

Well he has not been able to convey any of this to his staff. My daughter just flew Delta to get home for Christmas the last stretch was to be from Detroit to Elmira. The pilot was nice enough to regain time from Salt Lake for another pilot delay. But then in Detroit when they ran to their terminal the gate was closed and the people on the plan were waving to them but the plane sat on the tarmac for another 20 minutes. the employees, or someone could have called that pilot and asked him to wait 5 minutes for customers that have arrived and need to board that small unfilled plane to Elmira with no farther destination from Elmira till the next morning.

Have a heart Delta, people are trying to get to their families for Christmas.

If the delay is your fault Delta, try to make accommodations for people. My daughter and her husband were at the gate before the plane was ready to leave the gate! It's Christmas. It wasn't their fault the plane was late! It was Delta's. And it wasn't weather or a mechanical issue! Really? Did the person at the gate have to be a Grinch??

While in Tucson, there was a “maintenance” issue which caused us to miss our connecting flight in Minneapolis. When we finally left for Minneapolis, the flight attendants were rude and seemed annoyed with us, as if the passengers control the logistical mess. When we got to Minneapolis, we got a hotel and $15 meal voucher and were rebooked for the 7.45am flight out. It was then delayed to 8.30am then 9, then 10.30 all due to “maintenance”. We spent over $600 for each ticket one way for this abysmal service. Not to mention a blizzard is forecasted for the Midwest and they will most likely cancel the flight. If Delta is going to price gouge its passengers, it better provide planes that work so people can actually leave the airports. Let’s try being proactive rather than reactive Delta!

The times they changed them to were also the cheapest out of the original option. No reimbursement, no refund, no apology. We sent an email to corporate but never received a response and I spoke to a Delta representative at the airport and they told me to contact corporate again after my flight. Finally a week after the flight they contacted us and let us know they couldn't refund us because the flight had already passed... very shady and unacceptable behavior on Deltas part.

Once they closed the doors I moved, the second attendant came back signing with hands and face ""what am I doing?"" I explained but she seemed irritated, I asked is that ok? While looking at her phone she nodded yea and waved her hand as if to say leave her alone. Then made an announcement they were about to take off and ""no more switching of seats"", if the doors are closed doors it really matter if someone that's been traveling all day wants to stretch out? And it wasn't necessary for her to vent her frustration of me invading her private time in the back by calling me out on the PA. At the end as I got up I realized I need to use the restroom, she's standing in the way and from being exhausted I said ""is that the restroom"" instead of can I get to the restroom, and she responded with a ""yea!""

I've been flying with Delta for almost 12 years now. Their services are getting worse ever since past Covid. For staff at check-in desk lacking knowledge of latest Covid rules and restrictions of destination country, mandating covid vaccination up-to-date in 2022 when nobody asks for it any longer. If I wasn't a dual citizen, I would've been denied boarding. Ridiculously rude behavior once you dare to raise your concerns and try pointing them to Delta's own site describing the rules. Customer service is horrible. I recall the days when Delta Customer Service person was a pleasant experience to talk with, courteous, going out of their way trying to help you. Those days are unfortunately gone. Being a Delta Gold member (not that it means anything anymore), I was expecting at least to be helped out with offering options. One leg of my returning flight was cancelled 2 days prior to my outbound departure. Me and my entire family was denied boarding until we get it sorted out with Delta Customer Service - all this at the airport, with the Delta personnel at the check in desk telling us while pointing to the service phone: You need to call Delta Customer Support first. What do you make out of that? Is this really how the airline should treat their customers after a change to the trip was done by Delta itself?

Even though her incompetence caused the delay, she didn’t seem concerned at all and I did not even receive a simple apology.

Even though we were not able to leave the airport right away, there were great entertainment options to choose from. The crew was friendly and helpful. The seats were comfortable. They offered a variety of complimentary snacks. The granola bar was delicious. I was having a hard day and one of the flight attendants took notice and was extra friendly. He went the extra mile to help me to have a good experience. I will definitely fly with Delta again."

Missed our flight after waiting in line for two hours to get our bags checked in. Employees didn’t even seem concerned. The line was so ridiculously long, everyone was irritated and anxious about their flight. No communication between the staff and passengers. A few people including myself, were sent back to the line after making it to the front desk because our flights weren’t “priority” at the time and by the time we made it back to the front desk, our flight was closed. Delayed our trip almost a full day. Never flying with Delta."

295,5,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft. Lauderdale to Detroit,December 2022,2,1,1,,3,,3,0,✅ Trip Verified ," I recently flew from Fort Lauderdale to Detroit, and was appalled at the lack of flight opportunities from Delta at that airport. Previous vacations revealed the same situation exists at Miami airport as well. As a frequent cruise traveler, I know that cruise line such as carnival, celebrity, princess, royal Caribbean, and others, routinely disembark and embark thousands of passengers every Friday from both Port Canaveral as well as Port Everglades Florida. The lack of flight opportunities from Delta represents a significant loss of opportunity in order to service their customers and make money. This situation required myself and my companions to be forced to wait several hours in order to obtain a flight back to our home destinations."

I’ve been a loyal Delta flyer for years now and this the 2nd time our flights have been delayed for a significant amount of time, this time the delayed has completely ruined our whole reason for flying, my mothers surprise 70th birthday celebration. I’m so disappointed, frustrated and believe Delta should attempt to make this right. There were no options given other than a full flight standby that we also couldn’t board. I tried contacting their customer service by text just to be given a link to file a complaint/no resolution, giving the message that they really don’t care too much about their customers. Will be cancelling my delta credit card & flying with other airlines."

Check in was okay using the priority lane through my FF status. The security at SEA took ages but that wasn't Delta's fault, boarding on to a brand new aircraft was organised so quickly at my seat 10F which was comfortable with lots of space. Departure was delayed 90 minutes due to a snow storm but again not Delta's fault and it was handled well with lots of information about the plane de icing process, once in the air crew where friendly and visible serving drinks and snacks. The aircraft was great with good entertainment quiet and clean, if I had any complaint it would be that perhaps a meal could be offered on a flight over 5 hours; considering the delay I was on the flight for almost 7 hours. Would use them again pretty good."

I bought a ticket for my husband, The flight time was 6:15 pm and he was supposed to attend to a very important business dinner and take care of family emergencies the day after, the flight was delayed and they kept changing the gate. ^he latest update was 9:54 pm and it wasn’t even a 100% guarantee! He decided to forget about it since the dinner was already canceled! He had to drive early morning the next day to take care of family emergency, not only it caused us unnecessary expenses such as two full tanks and an oil change because the car wasn’t ready to drive that much mileage but also it was a waste of time driving! Not only Delta is not taking responsibility and ignoring my request to reimburse us on the gas money at least, they do don’t even care enough to give us a call and let us explain over the phone, they only communicate over email and it took them 30+ days to respond and that was after I had to follow up otherwise they don’t care enough to take care of customers. They really don’t care. I’m going to pay more attention to reviews next time."

Glad for the time because there is one staff person to check in us non-priority people with bags, and a line 20 deep. Staff better, Delta.

Then stood at the empty customer service counter flagging Delta agents down x3 when an agent finally showed up. Mind you, I used the black phone prior to be told they couldn’t help me and I needed to go to the customer service counter. Waited at the airport for almost three hours trying to get accommodation and then had five hours at the hotel before getting back to the airport for the plane to leave late and then finally got to Rapid City only for them to lose my luggage and took over 1 hour to get my information to hopefully get my luggage someday.

She literally yelled at me, like a child. No one is as there to direct the flow of customers. The Agent, made me look like the enemy to everyone in line.

I haven’t encountered a flight attendant, a customer service representative or honestly anyone that is employed by Delta that has a good attitude, demeanour, or tone when communicating with customers. It’s honestly wild how they talk to any and every customer. Bold business strategy to charge twice as much as all of the competition and treat the people on your planes like inanimate objects. Folks get treated better and are addressed more properly at a McDonald’s than on any of the Delta aircraft I’ve encountered."

Both first class flight attendants in our recent trip from Boston to San Diego were excellent. Stephen provided drinks and responded to questions with quick service and smooth professionalism, and Vitidrana was simply outstanding all around. She was friendly & helpful, with a witty, great sense of humor. She went out of her way to make each passenger feel special, with personalized service and little courtesies I haven't seen before. The food and drink were also top-notch, not something you can frequently say about airline food. My husband & I were impressed and grateful for the entire flight experience and especially for the flight attendants' care. Great job with this crew, Delta!"
304,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Norfolk ,November 2022,1,1,,,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," I purchased my ticket for flight DL 1349, I was unable to purchase a comfort seat because the only seats available were blocked off by Delta with a X (2 in comfort, 9 in main). I was given a message that my seat would be selected at the gate. The website allowed me to purchased a comfort seat on the second flight. When I saw the Delta representative arrive to the gate I approached the counter said Good morning and asked how she was doing? Delta CSR response - what do you need, I explained that I needed my seat selected and asked if I could have one of the comfort seats. She stated no and continued to look at the monitor about 15 seconds of silence passed before I asked if there was a reason why. She stated in a very negative tone while rolling her eyes you purchased coach so you don't get to upgrade for free. I tried to explain it would not give me the option to upgrade to comfort because only available seats were blocked by the airline, I told Delta's CSR she could see that I did purchase comfort on my connecting flight. I asked could I pay the difference for the comfort seat. She stated you would need to repurchase a whole new ticket and I would not be reimbursed for the existing one. I then asked may I have row 36 seat C, she never responded never looked up just continued as if I never asked a question but took several deep breaths every few seconds. Again another 15-20 seconds of silence then she says I'm printing your new ticket. Delta's CSR decided to select a different seat with no explanation, she handed me the ticket and said next. Delta's CSR was rude, disrespectful, extremely unprofessional and lacks customer service and communication skills. If I could've received a refund I would have preferred to drive the 9 hours than to spend a dime with Delta."

The entire experience was great, start to finish. Flying in and out of MSP is always great, such a well thought out airport with lot of restaurants and amenities (even a chiropractor!!), and Delta ground staff made it easy with a super quick check in. Crew on MSP to SFO was good, although we had lots of rough air and didn't see them much. I really appreciated all the communication regarding this from the flight deck. The crew on way back last night, SFO-MSP, was excellent making several trips up and down the aisle offering beverages. They were also very pleasant and not just doing their job. Very happy I live in Minneapolis and have the opportunity to fly Delta to most of my travel destinations."

Allison was fantastic with my daughter, who wasn’t feeling great with allergies from the drastic climate difference. She was very friendly and helpful with bags and wrangling a 3 year old that has been up since 2:00am to catch the early flight! She made a new “best friend” and was able to juggle all the things as they were coming down the aisle. Flying into Raleigh in bad weather added some turbulence, but she made her a happy camper.

307,8,Boeing 767-332ER,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Bogotá,November 2022,4,5,5,5,4,5,4,1,✅ Trip Verified ," As usual Delta’s onboard staff is what has made me a loyal customer. Let’s begin Thanksgiving weekend at JFK was a bit of a mess as usual lines were long to check in as well as to get through customs. In total it took about two hours which made me arrive at the gate by the time they had started boarding. Once I entered the plane I was greeted by the cabin crew, there was a blanket and pillow in every seat and prior to take-off I was provided with headphones. About 50 minutes into the flight you could choose from a cheese plate or chicken salad sandwich along with beer, wine or non-alcoholic drinks. I was offered an extra meal since I asked for one which was good. Inflight entertainment was excellent. The only bad thing was the tray table was broken on my seat. Hour and a half prior to landing there was another drink service. One thing I didn’t see which I usually do on Delta is a water service halfway through the flight. We landed in Bogota on time and Delta excelled as usual. Also thanks to being a T-Mobile customer I was able to use wifi and internet throughout the whole flight free of charge."
308,7,A330-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,New York to Frankfurt,November 2022,3,5,4,4,2,,5,1,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Delta One check-in at JFK T4 was seamless. However, there was a long queue outside of the Sky Club. Though I had access to the ""priority line"", I skipped the lounge and went straight to the Amex Lounge. The main purpose of a lounge is to provide a nice space to relax before a flight. What is the point to get to a lounge that is ""at capacity""? With all the news I heard recently, this seems to be a chronic issue rather than an unexpected situation. Delta did not do any upgrade on its A330-200, meaning the Delta One seat was very old. It was relatively comfortable, but it was worn out with virtually no storage space. I think the most basic part of a business class flat bed seat is a small, secured storage space so passengers can put away small items like eye glasses, wallets and phones while sleeping. On the good side, staff are courteous and accommodating, and I can see a significant improvement in meal quality. They also provided slippers, which was a nice touch. I got a good deal for this flight, so I think it offered good value."

The Delta flights were to and from Atlanta - Amsterdam. KLM flights were from Amsterdam to/from Dubai. The KLM flights were great, everything worked correctly in first class and as usual the crew gives first class passengers a nice house model gift after the flights. The Delta flight was horrific, the plane was very old, did not work correctly was a flight from hell really and every passenger complained about the worst experience ever for a first class flight. Our delta first class seats on both flights did not have power working. Our media system - movies did not work. Does Delta care about this horrible experience? Appalled and disgusted with Delta!"

They could have been sour about spending their Thanksgiving at work yet they were positive and thankful for our service (especially Jasmine). In addition all gate agents went out if their way to ensure alternate arrangements from late flights. Thank you.

I appreciated the fact that everything was on time. Had a bad experience with the Broker (Priceline) but I dont believe that had anything to do with Delta so I won’t fault them. There are so many of them Delta can’t keep tabs on every little detail given by them. Seats were very comfortable and had more room than my last airline I used. The only two negatives I felt were that one plane had really old rear seat entertainment that was slow and only worked half the time. The other 3 flights were new and worked excellent. Didn’t bother me much because it was a short flight. A longer flight would have been a different story. Also, they only had water and coffee options and for the price it seems like you should at least have soda if not available paid beverages. Very on time airline and seems reliable. Liked that I could pick my seat ahead of time. I will fly again and maybe only through delta."

We are in seat 1 but were the last to be asked about food so, we were told what we were getting, no options. The flight attendant is much less than friendly. She ignored for us for a while while texting on her phone. Being in seat 1, we learned that we had to put all bags overhead, as there is a wall I front of us & a bar & safety kit beneath our seats. So much for having an underseat bag with everything we need to be able to get to quickly. I went to the bathroom in 1st class. There’s no way it was cleaned, the trash can was overflowing. "

On Alaskan and Hawaiian Air my family members were all fed a meal, the service flowed nicely, the onboard entertainment and Wi-Fi all went well. The seats were comfortable and not too cramped. I can say none of that about our Delta flight experience. The plane was in shabby shape, my wife’s seat cousin was broken, the screams did not work, we were packed in like sardines.

Even if you cancel over a month before your flight, you will not get a refund and you will be charged a cancelation fee. They will offer you “credits” instead of a refund, so it is completely possible for you to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars through Delta and not even get to fly anywhere. Steer to United or American as they are much more customer service focused and their cancelation/changes policies are far more lenient."

We had book a flight and DELTA changed the connection to Seattle with only a 35 minute layover for a flight in another terminal. (We did not choose this). It is physically impossible to make the connection in Seattle. Our plane landed on time and we ran to the gate with 10 minutes to spare - but they already left. Now we are leaving tomorrow and will miss the tour we had up. We were told they always leave 19 minutes early!  The hotel says that Delta pays for 30 rooms every night regardless because of this. Something is seriously wrong with management here. To begin with this route needs to be cancelled. And the inflight screen says free WiFi and messaging but after you go down that rabbit hole it’s only for T-Mobile customers. Typical Delta.

Then around 22:00 we were informed that the flight was delayed for about 9 hours and we would depart at 08:00 on November 13th. Employees sent us to desk agents in the airport who providing us with assistance. The desk I went to was the International assistance desk I believe. I happened to get in line first so that was a plus. Agents Kimberly and Dexter were assisting us and they were phenomenal. They helped with all information and kept me calm at a time where I was worried. I was provided with a hotel voucher and chose to lodge at the AC Marriott Gateway. I shuttled to the domestic terminal, got on the sky train and shuttled to the hotel. I didn’t like having to put down an incidental card at the hotel which authorized $20 as this expense was not in my budget but I understood it. Overall I was pleased with the accommodations made for me and really appreciate how helpful every employee was as I was asking directional questions to various workers along the way.

When it was time for me to go back home on Delta they had said the cabin was too full and so we were forced to check our bags under the plane. I had a duffel bag and when I boarded I could see out my window how rough they were handling it throwing it under the plane to store and when we went to baggage claim at the end of our trip at 11pm I noticed there were two holes torn on my bag and I went to go to customer service to file a claim and there wasn’t anyone around so I ended up driving two hours back home and open my duffel and saw that not only were there holes torn but there were also things broken in my bag.

I've always preferred Delta, and opened an Amex card to receive more benefits. However, making any modifications is a joke. They don't care at all about the experience. We had issues with our Hawaii trip, but really this review is about a trip we booked for next year. I realized that I needed one more day to do everything we want to on our vacation. So, my husband and I, sitting together, each on our delta apps went to change our flight. We didn't book on one booking because I used a voucher, and we used miles for KY husband. When you use a voucher it has to be on its own booking...which is annoying. Anyway, sitting together, at the exact same time, side by side, we go and change our flights. I was pleasantly surprised as I received a $50 credit by making the change. However, my husband's change errored out. Apparently he had to pay MORE miles to move the day, for the exact same change I received credit for. The explanation was that prices are subject to change at any time, but since it was the same time it made no sense. So anyway, I can't help but believe they gouge prices when redeeming miles. There is no other reason mine would have resulted in a credit. And his required an additonal 6000 miles. We had issues with our Hawaii trip as well. I like their flights, planes are more comfortable than others but Delta does not care at all about their customer experience, especially when making changes."

Before you are duped big time into buying DELTA Comfort Plus Class - you are out of your minds crazy! How do I know that you ask, because my family did! Here is what you actually get for all of that extra money you spent: You get the most awful selection of alcohol you ever want to consume! Wine in a can that is so bitter that you cannot take more than 3 tiny sips, if you can stomach that much. I really want to know...hey Delta where are the upgraded snacks? Because they were not on any of our 6 (indeed I said 6 flights!) Also I was freezing and according to the Delta website under ""COMFORT PLUS"" it clearly says complimentary pillow and blanket! When I asked my flight attendant for the little pillow and blanket, she looked at me like I was from another planet and said: ""We don't have any pillows or blankets Ma'am"". Just in case anyone should want to know our flights were on: Wednesday, September 21st, 2022. The first flight was Delta# 2836 going from Billings to Minneapolis, the second was Delta#2089 going from Minneapolis to Los Angeles, the third was Delta #0370 going to Hawaii. The fourth was Delta #DL523 going from Kona Hawaii to Los Angeles, the fifth was Delta #DL1145  going from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City and the final flight was Delta #3817 back to Billings. Our family spent thousands of dollars more just to get the extras of ""COMFORT PLUS""! Was it worth it? Considering we never received what was promised in their own description, I would say a big and huge hell no! You can all think that I am whining and whatever, but I want what I was promised and what I paid for. There is no more leg room in COMFORT PLUS than in Economy! Basically the only difference is that you get seated a tiny bit quicker. Same drinks and snacks. There are no pillows as advertised. However if you have a longer flight you will get very thin and blue hospital like small throw. In no way can it ever be compared to a ""blanket"". Let's face it this airlines is in business for only one reason and that is to take the customers money. They surely are not going to give it back to people in any way. So very disaapointed."

Told us we couldn't both board as we missed bag check by 1 minute. Then the plane left early without us. Agents guaranteed it would not leave because we checked in with them and they'd hold it for us to get there. 1225 schedule, left at 1221. "

Everything was perfect, from start to finish. Check in was smooth, and the agent in Boston even offered to check my bag in for free, it was a special promotion that Delta had. Once on board, we got delayed by about 15-20 minutes due to more fuel needing to be added since a new flight route was established. Due to rain and wind in Boston, the pilots were very informative in the fact that we would hit a lot of turbulence. They kept us updated at all times and we even landed in Miami early. Complimentary snacks, drinks, and earphones. A good selection of movies and tv shows for free. Even the Wi-Fi was free, and worked perfectly. The flight attendants were very friendly as well. I appreciated this experience with Delta and they’re my preferred choice of an airline now. I would recommend them to anyone."

They canceled our flight, did not notify us. We get to the airport, they tell us there’s nothing they can do. They put us on a flight for the next day, I had to get a hotel room to get home the next day. I missed a court date that I had for jury duty. I get to RDU airport to find my suitcase and my car seat broken, do not fly with this airline."

I've come to expect delays in flights, especially coming out of COVID, however Delta led myself and other passengers to believe connecting flights would be taken care of, right up until they weren't. If it's not a Delta-connected flight you're on your own, and not warned beforehand. Upon arrival, cabin crew advised us to speak to service desk, except they had all left by the time we'd arrived, and we spent the night hungry in LAX until 4:30am when they returned. Delta were quick to dust their hands of any responsibility and put it upon the other provider, when we were led to believe it would be coordinated for us. Our situation could have been easily avoided if passengers knew where they stood and what they needed to do from the beginning, rather than be led to believe all is well until you're with another carrier."

They promised to deliver it by 12am. They sent it to the wrong address at 1am. When I finally found my bag, it was damaged with a large dent in the top corner. When filing a claim they ask for things that NOBODY would have such as: 1. The date I purchased the bag, 2. The original receipt."

I was flying from Alaska to Maui, while I was in a layover in Seattle. I was flying into Maui for funeral preparations. The Delta flight was delayed several times that day, then canceled late afternoon. The Delta representative said they ran out of hotel vouchers and to find my own, handed me a non working phone number and said to call the number for my refund. Tried several times the number, tried several times online system with Delta for my refund. More than two months later, I have not had any acknowledgment from Delta on this issue or a refund.

Original time out of Milwaukee was 1:30 but it was changed to 1:00 with no notification but luckily were were there early enough. Then we were booked to fly out of Detroit at 4:30 flight 1285 to find out that flight no longer exist and they automatically put us on an 8:15p.m flight again no notification! The kicker is there was a 4:04 flight that they could have changed us to be more in line with what we originally booked but they want us to sit in the Detroit airport for 4 hours instead! The main issue I have is no notification of these changes and no desire by anyone to try to rectify.

They need to train customer service. This trip started out bad and got worse, I am a medallion member and will think twice before I fly with them. I have never been treated so rudely by people that cause the problem, to think I paid more to try to be loyal, not again! Fly anyone but Delta!"

Not only did they fulfill my needs, but they excelled to make my day better than it was moments before being assisted by them. They preformed a great example of team work while solving the matter at hand. I usually do not fly Delta because quite frankly its one of the more pricey airlines, however, after my last date of travel, I am now convinced Delta is definitely worth the extra dollars, both comfort and experience is highly valued with Delta and that should never go unnoticed. Both employees radiated an admirable work ethic."

After a 40 minute wait at the baggage carousel, we asked a Delta rep, who told us to open a claim when we get to our final destination. While that may have been true, the tone of indifference was not well appreciated. Another rep checked, and said it would be in Tampa, but not when we arrived there at 10pm that evening. Instead, the luggage would arrive around 7pm, the next day! We flew out of Tampa, but we live over an hour away in Sarasota. That necessitated a trip back to Tampa the next day to get our bags, which eventually showed up around 10pm. Thought Delta was better than that."

342,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to San Jose,October 2022,2,2,,,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Delta needs to get their act together. My flight was supposed to leave at 6:14 pm. Then it was delayed to 7:33. Then, it was delayed to 7:50. Then it was finally delayed to 9:54. I went to the Delta help desk, which only had one person helping my entire flight of 200+ people. When I finally got to speak to the representative, they said there wasn’t anything they could do, and they gave me a meal voucher. When I went to pay for my very simple, yet typically expensive meal, the server told me the voucher was only good for $15. Where are you going to get a meal in an airport (or anywhere in LA) for $15? When I went back to the help desk to confront them about giving me a meal voucher that would only cover a portion of my meal, which I was forced to get because of my delayed flight, they took so long that I missed my flight. On top of everything, every employee I dealt with was unempathetic and didn’t really care about my situation. They were almost smug about my being at their mercy. Needless to say, I will never be flying Delta again."
343,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Athens,August 2022,3,5,1,3,1,2,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Very dissatisfied with Delta Air Lines, I won't be traveling with them ever again. Last August 2022, I needed a ticket change of dates, and so I spoke to an international representative who assured me it could be done for a fee, and that it was feasible. Long waiting on the phone with Delta, until they hang up. I called again, and they said I needed to cancel my flight and ask for a refund because the change of dates wasn't possible. Surprised by their negligence, I proceeded and agreed on the refund. After one month, I called to check on the progress of my refund, they said it was taking longer than expected because of the season, but my case was registered so I should expect the refund in a few weeks. A few weeks passed, and no answer from Delta. I called again, same story, they said I just had to wait longer. After 2 months, I finally received an email from Delta recently saying they couldn't file the refund after all. I'm not sure if they're aware of what that even means."
344,1,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Rome,October 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified , This airline does not care about its passengers. Our flight is from San Francisco to Rome with connecting flight in Los Angeles. This airline does not have enough space for the passengers carry on. The person on the podium failed to call our group number so we ended at the end of the line. When we get to the podium to enter the plane they forced us to check in our carry on and we asked to get our carry on in Los Angeles. Delta refused and told us that we were not getting our carry on until we get to Rome. That is approximately 14 hours from the time we board. In the meantime we were not ready for check in so our medicines and necessities were in the hand carry. We didn't want to hold the line so needless to say I was not able to take medicines on time. This airline is pricier than other airlines and they have really bad customer service.

However, that quickly changed the airline canceled our tickets and then sold them off without telling us. I spent 6 hrs on the phone before they finally booked us in for a flight for the day after we were meant to leave. Then when we got to the airport the baggage drop person also Delta employee literally yelled at us because apparently we didn’t understand something he never explained. Although overall we were not over weight overall he still made us repack or the other option was to pay another $100 even though we had already paid for the extra bag. The planes are not cleaned properly there was rubbish in the compartment in front of my seat and dry drink dripped on the seat itself. The food was horrible, flight crew didn’t even tell us what it was. They only serve a meal in the first 2 hours of a 14 hr flight and the last 2 so you are going over 10 hrs with nothing but water. Most disgusting experience I’ve ever had with an airline not to mention the 2 hr delay at the airport because “ we are missing a pilot”. Delta should be ashamed."

This flight started late by more than an hour with some lapse in paper work, fueling etc. This caused my connection in LAX to be missed. Then instead of putting my on immediate connection from LAX to SJC, they made me run pillar to post begging with their rude service staff and stay standby on 2 flights one after another. I was stranded at LAX for close to 4 hours, before catching flight to SJC. They should have automatically confirmed me on the immediate connection but they let me beg to their rude staff multiple times before putting me on standby on 2 flights and waiting at LAX for 4 hours."

We made our reservation months ago and we were not able to sit together except for one leg of the flight. We should have been assigned seats up front because of the disabled person in our group. We should have been able to get seats together because of booking so far in advance. We even had to wait for a wheelchair and we're almost late for our connecting flight. I will never fly with Delta again!

However, there was plenty of room after getting to my seat and people behind me brought his/her carryon bag with them and stored it. The staff did not look. They did the same thing when I was going to Las Vegas. This is unacceptable. Especially since I am entitled to have one carry on bag. When I brought this to a flight attendant attention, I was ignored."
350,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Tel Aviv,December 2021,2,4,4,4,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Delta Airlines turned my trip with My 3 Kids into a complete nightmare. We were flying from Atlanta-GA to New York, then Tel Aviv - Israel. A trip that I had been doing for years with different Airlines. On December, 18th 2021, I got to the Airport 3 hours before the flight, as they requested, but the check-in line was moving extremely slowly. After about 1 hour and a half, I asked an employee to please help us make it in time for our flight. He assured me that we had enough time. Another half hour went by and I saw this person again. I went towards him and said I had one more hour to my flight with my kids and there were still a lot of people in front of me. Again, he was dismissive and said we would be able to make it on time. We finally made it to the check-in desk, got our boarding passes to the NY flight and the connecting flight to Israel and ran to security. I took it upon myself and apologized to all the people we were passing to get through security and get to our gate. Just as we got to the gate, the plane was already moving. We got there late. I was livid and I made it very clear that I was angry. The problem was that they knew we were on our way. We had already checked in, our names were on the list with assigned seats, and we had the boarding passes in our hands. I’m willing to bet that due to extremely bad management, they overbooked the plane; that is why they quickly closed the door and allowed the plane to take off. Eventually, a Delta Employee was able to put my kids and I on another flight to NY.  When we got to the gate, they had just closed it and refused to reopen it. I said to the employee “You knew we were on our way, our names were on the list. Why didn’t you wait for just 2 minutes? She did not answer, but again it’s obvious that they overbooked the plane. By now, I was going to miss our flight to Israel as well. I don’t think there was anyone on that terminal that did not hear my voice when I was yelling and screaming off the top of my lungs that Delta and its management are nothing but screw-ups and they don't care about their clients At this point someone came and told me she could help and would make sure that I would be on the next flight. However, we were going to miss the flight to Israel but there would be another flight in the evening that we would have to wait for (if I’m not mistaken about 6 hours). I did not care. I asked her to do whatever needed to be done. She started transferring our boarding passes from the flights we lost to the new flight to NY and the flight to Israel that same evening. However, she was only able to issue my and two of my kids boarding passes, but was having a problem getting the boarding pass for my other son. Time was getting very close to the flight going to NY, so she asked me to leave and in NY they would get him the boarding pass. When we got to NY, the first thing I wanted to do was to get my son his boarding pass. I went immediately to the Delta desk; the person there was taking forever, then someone else came in and started asking my son for his permit to travel and his Covid test. I told them that we had already been through this and he already had a boarding pass, but because of Delta’s poor management and flawed service, we lost 3 flights. All they needed to do was transfer his boarding pass to the next flight. However, this process was also taking long. They kept on asking him unnecessary questions and he was only 15. "
351,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Minot to Houston via Minneapolis ,October 2022,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Delta is screwing us all over. First we book a flight with them from Williston ND to Houston, they cancel that flight three weeks after we book it, tell us we can book another flight from Williston to Canada to Minneapolis to Houston. (Flight would’ve taken two days with the layovers) No thank you. So we decide to go through Minot to Minneapolis to Houston. Sounds great until two hours before boarding the delays start on that flight and surprise surprise it goes late enough we miss our connecting flight from Minneapolis to Houston. So if we would’ve chosen the cheapest option that included the most inconvenient times of day for a person with the longest layover we could’ve saved ourselves a couple hundred dollars from the beginning. Low and behold, we end up getting those flights and those layover anyhow but still have to pay the extra $200/ticket round trip. We will not be flying Delta again. Hence why on the way home we will be flying United. Delta needs to take a serious look at how many people they are effecting this way. If they care, that is. Also, to the flight attendants, if you are out of coffee, make more."

We booked our flights months before the travel date and paid to pick seats that included a window, and at first they tried to seat us all separate, with my 10yo riding by herself. As I told them this was unacceptable, they put us in the very last row in the airplane. I'm not complaining about that a much as the quality of the row. Literally the only row on the entire airplane without windows or working air vents. When I say the whole plane was sketch, it's an understatement. I mean, zip ties holding parts on, plane wasn't cleaned, had garbage all over the floor, etc. Onto the service. Was ignored 3 times while basically yelling for service. They stopped us from entering airplane for 2 minutes while first class was served. Like 25 people sitting there waiting, while some entitled customer was served his Coke. I can go on, but you get the drift. I will never fly delta again.  I expected better from delta, I was wrong. I will never fly Delta again."
353,3,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Portland,October 2022,4,2,,5,1,4,2,0,Not Verified , I would like to start by saying I didn't feel the hospitality on my last flight. I had 2 children age 4 and 7 and felt as if I was being lied to and cussed at. We had 2 booster seats that had pink tags on it that were left at the front of where you board the plane to get put under. As we arrive into Portland Oregon (PDX) we get off the plane and our booster seats are nowhere to be found. We stand there waiting for almost 40 minutes before anyone asked what we needed help with. Then they proceeded to tell me that they must have gone to the baggage claim. After 20 minutes (mind you its well over an hour and a half since we landed) at the baggage claim they had taken them off to the side of the baggage claim and never said anything to us. I will keep other airlines in my mind next travels.

Upon boarding the plane I realized I left it in the terminal. The flight attendant took the time to go out and look for it for me, but was not able to find it. Then he said another flight attendant did see it in the restroom, but when they went to retrieve it, it was missing. He took the time to come tell me all of this, and comped me with airline miles - which in my opinion is above and beyond - since it wasn’t their fault I had forgotten it. But it really made my day!"

Our flight to Atlanta arrived on time and we went straight from one gate to the other and when we got there the door was shut in our face and we’re told we had to get on the next flight. After waiting quite a while at the unattended desk at the gate the person finally came back and after asking several times why they didn’t let us on she finally told us that our seats were released 10 mins prior to departure! There was not enough time to make it from one to the other before they released our seats and gave them to someone else! Why would they even put you on a connecting flight that is next to impossible to make?! I do however want to say the gentleman at the customer service desk was helpful and ensured we all got on the next flight but pretty much said don’t do a short connection in Atlanta… maybe the airline shouldn’t sell them this way then?! Other than that flights were fine, I would still use Delta again but never for a layover/connecting flight"

So, currently flown two Delta flights these last two days and experienced truly an airline that lacks communication between ground and air, as well maintenance. First flight is late, after landing sent to a gate with a plane parked, so waited 20-25 minutes to arrive at another gate, and there is no representative therefore need to wait another 15+minutes. My second Delta flight, plane cleaning crew works overtime cleaning our plane for 45 minutes and we are taking off late again, and then we board plane and air conditioning is not working, so it’s approximately 90 Fahrenheit, or 37 Celsius and we continue to wait on why we haven’t left after seated for still over 50 minutes. The funny part is they communicated to us about their own incompetence. The best news is no chance to timely get to my connecting flight and may have to spend the night, more money and valuable time wasted! Do not waste time with Delta."

Our 6.10pm flight was delayed until morning - they let us know at about 11pm after being told approximately 4 or 5 times, with the times going back and forth. Not one passenger was able to utilize the hotel ""voucher"" and we couldn't access our meal vouchers until we declined the hotel voucher or found a room among the non existent rooms available. We were offered cots and blankets in the baggage claim area. This simply isn't good enough. I especially feel for the customers on the elderly side and the disabled."

I was not notified via email or text or call though I gave Delta all my information and permission to contact me. I had received email confirmation of my flight and texted my boarding pass. I was never notified that my flight was canceled. The lady at the counter was useless. Told me she could rebook me on a flight I said okay and then she said sorry it looks like it was taken there are no other options for you. For a refund you need to call customer service or contact them online. I go online and start chatting with an agent. Agent says there's nothing she can do. At this time I call Delta and wait on hold. I have to get in contact with a third and fourth person to get on a flight that works for me, no compensation or sorry or refund. Get better reps. Get better service. Any person that gets their flight canceled day of should get some sort of voucher or compensation. I can't believe that I had to go through this"

On this flight in first class, the flight attendant offered no drinks or snacks before the flight took off. Once the flight was in the air she left first class and went back to the economy section for over an hour. She did not return once during that time. She returned around 1:25 PM and finally started to take our drink orders. Then stopped and told us she did not have time to get our drink orders and went around with the snack basket. Then she walked back to the economy section with a pot of coffee before taking her seat a few minutes later. I was shocked that this is how the first class was treated on this flight. I thought about saying something to her once she did come back to first class, but decided I did not want to cause any kind of trouble. I know that she knows what her job is in first-class she just chose not to do it and help the flight attendant in the economy. No apology from her and she seemed perfectly fine that she left first class for over an hour and never once came back to check on us. My question to you is why did a pay for a first-class experience and receive by far the worst experience I have ever had on a flight?

For the past 5 years delta has been my choice airline. I’m in the military and and frequently traveling and delta was always a safe choice for a positive experience. This was until September of 2022 when I took military leave from South Korea to America with my fiancé from South Korea. We ordered the tickets 4+ months before the flight but despite this we were seated very far from each other. My fiancé was very nervous and scared because it was her first time flying and going to America and was forced to sit alone. I tried to get this resolved but they were unable to help me. Then when trying to return from America to Korea they waited last second to find an issue with the plane that resulted us to have to all get off the jet and be delayed hours. The plane was in the boarding area for 2 hours before and they didn’t find the issue until the very last moment. I don’t know what is up with Delta but this is now 2 times in a row they have screwed me over and I feel embarrassed this is my fiancés first experience with an American owned airline.
365,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Louisville to Kansas City via Atlanta,September 2022,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ," I was going to try to forget about my experience with this airline, but reading these reviews has inspired me to write this review just to get it off my chest. Practically everyone associated with my trip on Delta (with the exception of the pilot, who I only saw once as I de-boarded the plane) was not only rude but personally insulting. Waiting at the gate for the last leg of my trip, a flight from Atlanta to Kansas City, two female employees at the gate counter acted like they were in a high school girl's bathroom - cackling and laughing like witches over the intercom mike while blurting out info about boarding the flight. I'd never heard such juvenile and unprofessional behavior before, and the whole time I asked myself why would a company hire these characters. Pickings must be extremely slim. The flight attendants at the front of the plane waiting as I boarded the plane were no better. The male-female duo were rating the looks of passengers as they came on board: ""That's a two"" said the female. ""No, that's a one and a half"" said the male attendant. Naturally, as usual, they were two extremely gorgeous specimens who had plenty to say about other people in the looks department, like most of these extremely rude types of characters do. If I didn't have to get to my destination on time with more important things to attend to than rude flight attendants I would have stopped and reprimanded them, but I wisely kept moving to my seat. I've dealt with some real bad apples on a number of these airlines, just trying to get from point A to point B, and I realize that the service industry in general is going down, but this experience on Delta Airlines was the worst yet and is putting me off of flying altogether. It's not bad enough how paying passengers are treated during the pre-flight checks, but then you have to go through the insulting, rude and unprofessional conduct of the Delta counter people and flight attendants. Makes me want to set aside a week, get a car and drive to my destinations rather than go through the clown show that Delta and other airlines are running."
366,2,,Family Leisure,First Class,Milwaukee to Boston,September 2022,2,1,1,,4,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Milwaukee to Boston. WARNING: If you check in and are asked if you want to upgrade to first class for only $100, do not agree! It is a rip-off. All Delta did was move us from row 6 to row 3. There appeared to be nothing first class about the seat. Maybe it was an inch or two wider and a couple of inches of leg room. I didn't have an opportunity to compare but the actual seat was about the same as an economy seat in JetBlue. The only extra service was a couple of minutes early seating and orange juice before taking off. After that there was no flight attendant assigned to first class and no meal. There was only the same basket of snacks that was provided to everyone. I never heard of first class without a meal, so I didn't buy anything in the airport. About an hour after one small bag of potato chips I asked for another, but they had none left. For the two of us it was $200 down the drain."

I arrived in Salt Lake City Costco and I had to stand outside for 20 minutes before I could come in. I am in Chicago being told I have to wait 30 minutes before I can come in. Whoever makes rules like these and forces their employees to implement them as a complete idiot. I am traveling first class I am in the Premier category travel frequently and need to contact business and work. I will never fly Delta again after decades unless they change this policy
368,1,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Atlanta,September 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I don't travel frequently and I was traveling alone. I was taking the trip of a lifetime for me to go to the Laver Cup in London. I haven't travelled Internationally and was encouraged by concerned friends to travel business class because I've had spine surgeries. Paying an extremely exorbitant price for a business class round-trip ticket to London was disappointing. For such a price, (several thousand dollars) one should get a decent experience, or at least an experience that justifies the price. Business class ride from Minneapolis to London was mediocre at best, short on food, and what was served was tasteless and lukewarm, monitors not working requiring multiple re-sets, movies reported to be available were not, and home from London to Atlanta was absolutely no class. The seats were very uncomfortable. The only way to elevate feet higher than a miserable 2-3 inches was to lay completely flat. The monitor was stuck on another language and had to be re-set multiple times before finally workable. They ran out of food - note to self- choose the first seats left the front of business class to ensure you get food options and not whatever's left!. "
369,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Kansas City,September 2022,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  The first flight was great. The flight home disgusting and the crew doesn't care. I had liquid dripping on me out of the luggage rack, and the crew will tell you it's fine its just the ac. Went with delta because they claim to be the cleanest with the most leg room and free wifi if you have t-mobile (which we do). The seats had not been cleaned, the window had finger prints and forehead smudges to the point I used the sanitizing cloth they give you (that I can only imagine is to clean your seat and area for them as they are too lazy to do it). There was dust around the ac vent so what was dripping on me wasn't from the ac. They didn't make any announcements to tell you that we were in turbulence and needed to stay seated. There was a gentleman standing rocking his baby while we have seatbelt signs on and they never said a word to him. They just turn the light on saying to keep seated with your seatbelts on. But they will announce that everything is safe and the seat belts are no longer needed to keep you safe. The WIFI did not work on either flight.  The flight attendants were rude. Delta needs to do maintenance and upkeep on their planes as well as attempt to clean them at least once a week."
370,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Tri Cities via Atlanta,June 2022,,,,,,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I booked a ticket with Delta in March 2022 to fly from Chicago from/to Bristol (Tri-Cities), Tennessee, via Atlanta, in June for a conference. Delta cancelled my initial flight a few hours before it was due to depart, rebooking me for the next day (via LGA) and not getting me in until the next evening missing the entire critical first day of the conference. I was told at the airport that bad weather prevented the crew of making it to Chicago on time for the flight. I had to book a ticket on the spot on American Airlines, which could get me to Tennessee the same night. I applied for a refund of the cost of my Delta ticket, which finally was paid over a month later. I also applied for compensation for the fare difference caused by Delta's cancellation (just under $400). Today, over three months later, my request was refused. I was given a ""sorry"" flight credit coupon for $50. It will go unused, as I will never fly Delta again. I hope that this review is published, even though the trip was cancelled, because it is relevant to anyone counting on this airline to get them somewhere."
371,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Cleveland,September 2022,1,1,,,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I booked a flight from LGA to Cleveland so that I could attend a wedding. I was a groomsman for the wedding and was looking forward to participating in all of the events. I found some flights that worked for my schedule and they happened to be Delta whom I do not typically choose as travel partners. I had coordinated plans with people based on my itinerary but unfortunately found out, that when flying with Delta, a set schedule is always subject to change and your efforts to be a dependable person in regard to your commitment is jeopardized with their great ineptitude of being a reliable transportation service. It might be easiest to understand my disappointment and frustration by simply looking at the attachments of the update texts. From all of my other travel experiences, which I am fortunate and grateful to say is plenty and well above average, I usually receive 1-2 update texts mostly with confirmations of flight and gate information. Delta operates differently than their competitors however as they like to send 10-12 texts with new gate information and change of departure times. For those who like spontaneous adventures, simply book a flight with Delta and you'll be running around the airport all day with changes of departure times every 30-45 minutes! Unfortunately due to all of this irresponsible and unreliable service from Delta, I held many people up and changed a lot of people's schedules simply bc I didn't know when I was going to get in. Eventually plans were canceled and I, with the help of Delta Airlines, ruined a night of fun which was planned a long time in advance. I will say that Delta is consistent in that the return flight was just as bad. I was supposed to take off at 12:15pm and it's currently 5:15pm and our flight has now been pushed back until 7:10pm. Believe me, I'm not holding my breath! In summary though, Delta has proven to me that it is a completely unreliable travel service with little to no regard nor respect for it's customer's time nor plans. If you are someone that would like to pay the same amount of money as their competitors but have no security in when your flight will actually take off, Delta airlines is your best bet. If you purchase flights with a purpose and make plans around the set schedule the airline commits to, then you should be sure to filter out Delta in your search."

Flight out no problem. nice flight, luggage secure. Return flight however a different story. Both my luggage lock and my son's were missing upon our return to DTW. These were TSA approved locks so if TSA felt the need to search all they had to do was unlock the locks, inspect and return the locks. But no. There was no ""Notice of Inspection"" in the luggage which leads me to believes Delta employees breached our bags. Nothing was missing from either bag? The thought of employees indiscriminately rummaging through our belongings is upsetting to say the least. Also, I had some OTC cold medications (Dayquil / Nyquil liquid) wrapped in a plastic grocery bay with the lids securely tightened. When I opened my bag the Dayquil had leaked all out of the bottle. A little escaped the grocery bag but could have been a huge mess. I fly Delta every time I fly as I am a Sky miles member. This episode is causing me to rethink my loyalty to this airline. Don't bother contacting customer service either."

When I arrived she asked about my back pack which I just learn my seat didn’t have stow away. Finally another guest went out of her way to help. Very shocked at the whole process and rudeness of the staff. Never have I ever experienced a flight attendant talk or handle a simple act like this.

I missed my connection in Detroit because it took too long to offboard folks from our first flight to Westchester to Detroit. Then with a poker face the Delta representative tells me that “sadly” the next flight I’m booked on now is in 8 hours! Doesn’t offer any type of compensation. In Europe, when you are delayed by over 3 hours you get compensated, I don’t understand why not in this case."

The flight to Atlanta was on a clean, modern jet with ample space (Comfort+) and conscientious, friendly, professional service. Even had in-flight entertainment for a flight that took less than two hours. No serious complaints for an airline with which I have rarely had negative experiences over the years - from the perspective of being an actual customer of the airline. However, I have a few suggestions for some of their hubs: they could stand to work with the Atlanta airport authority to modernize ATL and enforce standards of cleanliness, to update the airport from 1999 to the modern era and to make it a truly world-class airport rather than the busiest. Delta has the onus since Atlanta is their headquarters and primary global hub, and nearly 75% of all passengers arriving into and departing from Atlanta are using Delta. Delta should also work with the Seattle airport authority for the same thing. A significant share of passengers in Seattle also use Delta, as they are the airline's hub for the Northwest."

I chose comfort plus when booking flight but on the return trip I was in the main cabin. It would not let me select comfort plus seat that was x'ed out but not occupied. When I called they just said your are in a mixed cabin (whatever that means). The receipt did not show the breakdown of cost, all I know is I booked for comfort plus. Going to LAX I was in comfort plus and returned in economy and there wasn't much difference."

I have called to speak to someone to get some information about changes that were made by the airline. I first called and was told that the wait was 14 minutes and they could call me back without me loosing my place in line, so I did that. 25 minutes later I called back because no one called me. I have now been on hold for what was originally said to be 14 minutes then changed to 21 and then the recording said I was being transferred to an agent and I have now been listening to the agents in the back ground talking to each other, I presume, for the last 45 minutes and no one has answered my call yet. I can hear them talking and someone moving around close by. I have screamed hello into the phone multiple times to no avail. I have never been so aggravated in my life. Is there even such a thing as customer service any longer. I also left my thoughts on the phone call just in case it really was being recorded like it says, but I am sure no one will ever hear it. This along with many other reasons is why I like to fly SWA. At least they do have customer service. "

They both said the departure gate wouldn’t listen so no point. I made it to the connecting gate 10 min before departure and watched them close the door. They wouldn’t let me on the plane. We’re all just cattle to delta these days. May as well just go with the best, cheapest flight when I travel from now on. If I’m just a commodity, so is Delta.

380,1,,Solo Leisure,First Class,Ft Myers to Dayton via Atlanta,September 2022,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I flew on a first class ""Sky Priority"" ticket, and as such went to the Sky Lounge in Atlanta. Mind you, I recall an email where they said they'd updated their rules, so I stopped at the door and read the rules on the sign. I saw nothing that seemed to apply to me, so along with other passengers I trekked up the 4 flights to the desk, where I was promptly rejected and told to leave. It turns out that they now require you to have an American Express card, and I was offered the chance to apply, or get out. So I left- I don't want or need more credit cards in my life. Don't get me wrong either, the staff were friendly and professional, and obviously caught in the crappy position of rejecting formerly qualified customers. I don't care that they changed the rules, business is business. I do mind that I was publicly embarrassed when it could have simply been posted at the door. I sat in the concourse nearby to see if it was happening to others and counted 12 other passengers who entered, and came back out looking embarrassed and/or angry. Is it Delta's policy to subject their employees to angry, surprised, embarrassed passengers? And is it their policy to make us resent flying with them? Because that's what's happening with this arbitrary oversight. Put updated signs on the doors, save us all some headaches. Oh, and get rid of the ""sky priority"" language, maybe it should say ""sky priority, but only with a Mastercard"" or something stupid like that. Thanks,"

The outbound flight in Comfort Plus offered pillows, blankets and food for purchase. In contrast, on our overnight return flight from Lihue to Seattle, they ran out of food and had no pillows or blankets for 1st class. We seriously feel that the additional cost we paid for 1st class was a total waste and disappointment. The flight attendant apologized and did make an effort to scrounge up some snacks. The cost of 1st class is exorbitant for senior citizens and failed to meet our expectations in this case."

Hubby did explain when he booked it originally we sitting together now we were not. The CSR took the time to explain what happened on the original booking and where the changes were made. She did apologize to my husband and she did her best to accommodate us and manage to upgrade us at the same time to comfortable seating. This was nice at the time while trying to resolve our issue. I can't complain about the staff, as they were friendly and polite. What I did not like was that they need to enforce when we are existing the plane, it should be row per row. I did not like the fact people just got up from there seats and were very rude practically pushing there way thru to leave the plane. That's the only part I did not like. If you work for the Airline Delta Carrier please be aware of what is happening on the plane. I strongly suggest On your speaker do say ""Row per Row please""!! And do tell everyone on the plane b-4 existing its row per row starting with the front of the plane FIRST!!! There is NO Etiquette when it comes to existing the plane. Some people are just plane RUDE. Aside from that I had no crazy issues with Delta as this is my first time using this air carrier. I normally fly South West or Jet Blue.

The flight staff from SFO to ATL were very professional the best I have seen in 20 years but they were training 2 new crew member. Check in was fast (tsa security was slow) at SFO they have clear pass and tsa pass this puts a bottle neck for other passangers. Seats on all legs were large and comfortable even at back of plane. Entertainment system was good, with free earphones. The planes were kept a bit too cold, on international they give you a blanket.

From the start my flight from San Diego got delayed due the aircraft maintenance issues which caused me to miss my connecting flight and have to stay in Atlanta an extra day. They couldn't get me a new flight until 6pm the next day which caused me to miss my best friends wedding and wasted $200 on suit rental for no reason but they gave me a hotel room and meal vouchers for me and my 3 children. When flying back to San Diego I tried to use the meal vouches that I didn't get a chance to use yet and they ""expired"" even though the expiration date is still good. When going to guest services they asked my wife and I why we didn't use them right away and she's not going to issue them back. Horrible customer service, I will make sure none of my Marines fly Delta."

397,2,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Denpasar,July 2022,2,2,3,3,1,,3,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  This is a story about how a 39 hour journey from the Western continental Americas, sadly, became a 5 day trip, chock-full of obscure flights, lost suitcases, international airports on graveyard shift, and poor food to hold me over while I slowly worked my way back to Indonesia. My home away from home for decades, equipped with children and a career I need to return to with some semblance of a plan… however, that plan is being obliterated by Kiwi.com/ Delta Airlines as I speak! I’m sitting here, 10 kilometers from Incheon airport, where I shall sit until the first flight to Bali that has a seat available, is willing to transport me. This is all Delta’s doing at the moment, and I cannot believe my own story as I sit back and revel in it while typing. Kiwi.com, however, as a travel agent, is rather complicit in my defenseless position. I’d be happy to tell you my itinerary was put together by Kiwi.com, with a seemingly flawless algorithm, until I realized that this itinerary relies on every facet of transfers, Covid testing, and airline employees executing their job duties in a timely, effective manner. When this chain is disrupted by one weak link working for Delta Airlines, I became occupational hazard in the flesh, missing flights, having to pay unreal sums of money because we have flight stewards who aren’t attuned to my needs. I started July 26th, 2022 with a flight from Austin, Texas, USA scheduled to 8pm… From there to go on to Houston, TX with an 11 hour layover before boarding my Seoul, S. Korea flight, and ultimately from S. Korea to Bali, Indonesia.  My first July 26th flight from Austin to Houston was canceled and rescheduled for the following morning - requiring my 2nd flight from Houston to Atlanta (where I would make my connection to Seoul and onwards home to Bali) to be delayed. This was flight DL1315. I had downloaded the Kiwi.com App as recommended to receive updates and none of this information was posted there. Kiwi.coms’ app was actually such a joke, that my google profile became the de facto OS for me, alerting me to flight delays and suggesting nearby hotels. First off, I am a foreign national in Indonesia, and my passport and visa paperwork clearly show this. However, the woman at the Delta boarding gate in Houston insisted her computer was not up to date on the half a dozen different visas Indonesia gives its ex-pats, and that I could only enter as a tourist. “Fine” I say, “enter me as a tourist.” But a tourist must show an outbound international flight to enter Indonesia. Naturally, as a permanent resident of Indonesia, I had booked a 1-way ticket home to Bali. Despite all my pleas and .gov info from Indonesia Customs online, Delta would not allow me to board the seat I paid for until I ordered an outbound tic"
398,7,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to London Heathrow via Salt Lake City,August 2022,3,1,3,2,3,,2,0,Not Verified ,"  Being someone who is hard of hearing and having to wear hearing aids it is really difficult on a flight when they only provide small in ear headphones for the entertainment system. I usually remember to take my own over the ear ones and am able to leave my hearing aids in which enables me to hear cabin crew and still maintain conversations with people as well as make use of the entertainment. Yesterday on a flight with Delta I had forgotten my own and asked the cabin crew member if they had any over the ear headphones, he just looked irritated and said no just these and handed me the little in-ear ones and walked off. I didn't fancy staring into space for 10 hours so I removed my hearing aids and tried my best with the in-ear phones, I turned the volume up full and just about managed to hear the system. The only problem with this was that I could then not hear what cabin crew were saying or any of the safety announcements. It was not a nice experience to have cabin crew rolling their eyes to other people when I couldn't hear what they said the first time, it was extremely embarrassing and uncomfortable. This was not a nice flight and I don't think I would fly with Delta again because of it. I will say that apart from that experience the rest of the flight was okay."

The flight departed at 9:20 pm and it was the last flight to San Diego that evening. I misread the boarding time as the departure time and got to the gate late. The door was closed and the jet bridge was moving away from the plane. I spoke to the gate agent and explained I misread my ticket. One of the male flight attendants on the plane saw me at the gate. The gate agent, flight attendant, and the pilot all spoke and decided to open up the doors for me to board. They obviously did not have to do that and it is unheard of. It was at the end of their shift and they could have handled the situation a million different ways, but instead decided to bless me and extend grace to me for my mistake. I was beyond grateful to them for going above and beyond for me. Thank you Delta crew on flight 2759 for your incredible customer service!"

Wheel broken off suitcase and deep gouge in fabric. Obviously mishandled. Okay - this happens. The next day I was about 200 miles away in Denali and tried to file a claim by phone. Tried to make a claim by website. Totally impossible. I was on various forms of chat for almost an hour. Kept getting rerouted to various departments most of whom turned out to be robot computers - they sound good at first, till you finally figure out they are not real people and they tell you essentially your question is beyond them. At one point I got a person who was nice but she went off shift before anything resolved. Going in circles. Finally gave it up as an impossible quest. At one point was told all I could do was file a complaint as I did not report it at the airport - at 2am. My time is worth more than this or the suitcase, which was not even new and for which I would have settled for maybe $75. Left a very bad taste. Especially since I was on vacation. I am 87 years old and was at the start of a solo 16 day journey through Alaska by car - having a suitcase that won't roll and that I can't pick up is very stressful - I just left it in the boot of the car. Delta should have better customer service. The flight itself was fine."
401,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Tokyo via Atlanta,August 2022,,,,,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I have never experienced such absolutely appalling, rude, and condescending customer service in my life as I did at the counter in Midway. Short, snippy, and sarcastic, the agent seemed to want to have very little to do with us from the minute we stepped to the counter. No smile, no hello, no greeting. And it was all downhill from there. We had been planning for my son to participate in a foreign exchange program for a year and a half. Made all the arrangements, did all the research, and checked all the boxes. We chose Delta because they had an arrival time inside of a time window we needed to meet. Simple enough. He is a minor. He is old enough to opt out of the Delta Unaccompanied Minor program, where they charge an extra $150 and require someone at the destination to jump through a bunch of hoops to pick him up. The host organization already had a process in place. We researched the unaccompanied minor rules and regulations. The host organization would have someone waiting to meet with him at the gate in Japan. No problem. We chose to opt out of the unaccompanied minor program because the Delta website rules specifically state: https://www.delta.com/us/en/children-infant-travel/unaccompanied-minor-program ""If I decline the Unaccompanied Minor Service for my 15-17 year old, can I still accompany them to the gate? Yes. If you are dropping off or picking up your minor but opted out of the Unaccompanied Minor program, we will issue you a pass to accompany your child to the gate. Please check with an airport agent at the time of check-in to have the gate pass issued."" We arrive at the ticket counter to begin the process and the agent is visibly annoyed that she now has to go through all of this process first thing in the morning (visa, passport, covid test verification, etc) and she makes it very clear through her body language and attitude that she is annoyed. Then we get to the part where I request a pass to accompany my son to his gate. She responds ""No. He's old enough to travel by himself."" I mention the rules we had researched, and after some tense back and forth, she says ""no, we're not Southwest."" Now, tensions are escalating and my son is upset. She even walks away at one point to go do something else that seemed completely unrelated to us. I know if I escalate any further, I run the risk of expulsion from the airport, so we take our boarding pass and move away. My son is very upset at this point and asks if there is anything else we can do. We get back in line to try a different agent. This one is even worse. I opened the discussion with a recap of our previous encounter and even showed her the Delta website I had pulled up on my phone. She looks right at it and says the only thing she can do is enroll him in the unaccompanied minor program. So I say, ""ok, let's do that."" She rolls her eyes and her shoulders slump. She leans forward, places her hands face down on the counter looks up with her head cocked to the side and says ""fine. But I'm going to need a lot of information."" She has us fill out a form which is quite comprehensive, then starts pausing at every other word to ask if the spelling is correct. The process drags on so long, and the tension was so uncomfortable, that my son asks if we can just go. I express to them that the amount of trouble to go through this when the rules clearly state that it should amount to a simple request is ridiculous. So my son started his trip alone. Lesson learned."

When we arrived in the Airport, we went to the Delta desk speaking with a supervisor who gave us a lot of problems. First she asked for extra money without checking our online ticket, where everything was already paid. Than when she discovered her mistake, she started to be rude and asking for extra money again without explain us that we could avoid it. Fortunately later we changed desk, where we found a gentleman who explained us that the problem was the weight and we could balance all our bags.

I selected the seats for myself and my son with autism when purchasing the tickets. When I was about to board at the gate, they gave me a paper with a newly assigned seat information. I did not know it until I got into the plane. I did not understand why they reassigned the seat, but I selected the particular seats to stay with my son with a disability, so I could not accept the reassigned seat. I asked the flight attendant the reason why it was reassigned and if they could help me to find a way to seat with my son together. Their attitude was extremely condescending and just told me to go to the reassigned seat even if I explained the situation about my son. I was very frustrated by the situation and did not know what to do. They stayed far and stared at me with a look that I was interrupting other passengers behind me who tried to have a seat. It was extremely unpleasant with their attitude. At least, I wanted to know the reason for the seat reassignment, but they ignored my right and did not help. They failed to respect and listen to the passengers traveling with a child with a disability."

Getting on from Cincinnati was fine but getting off the plane at Minneapolis was a nightmare. 3 grown men couldn’t figure out how to lift a 160lb person. They have no proper training of how to move a patient properly. They let his top half tip over. Then they couldn’t get his motorized $50k chair off even though he told them how to do it they were just annoyed and didn’t listen to anything he said. They wanted to put him in a chair without a chest strap and basically send him on his way. If this is their job and they offer these services they need to be trained properly and not have an awful attitude when they’re not the ones paralyzed. Then at the end they were so adamant about our boarding passes to get paid. You almost hurt him and almost broke his wheelchair you don’t deserve anything from your terrible mean “assistance”.

We found multiple other options with other carriers, but Delta didn’t want to pay for those. On our own dime, we took a 15 hour train to Amsterdam to fly out on 4 Aug. Upon arrival in Boston, we spent nearly 3 hours on tarmac due to mechanical issue before returning to gate. No hotel voucher provided to spend night in Boston.

There were a lot of mix ups (we didn’t get the baby bassinet we reserved, we didn’t get the 100% fruit meal we reserved, etc.) and many times it felt like the right hand has no idea what the left hand is doing. The most challenging issue was that the connection flight was several hours late and no genuine support was given for a place to rest which can be especially hard for families with babies and young children. If your priority is health, especially for medical conditions or families with small children, higher quality airlines might be a better fit. The food was fine, not the freshest but not poor quality. They kept advertising about how free the wifi was but when you go in, it’s only free for T-Mobile subscribers (felt like either a bad joke or deliberate deception). In-flight entertainment however was about an 8/10 (lots of great English movies music etc for all ages, but almost nothing available for other languages [only subtitles])."

Four tickets purchased together with minors and Delta can’t put me on the same row on a red eye flight with unassigned seats.  Happened on way from New Orleans to Salt Lake. When they cancel a flight and you then have an overbooked flight with everyone scrambling fighting over seats because the seating has changed with no notice. So one guy is saying this is my seat with his ticket on his phone and another individual with a printed ticket with the same seat. Instead of making an announcement, the staff leaves the passengers to argue and figure it out then tell everyone they have to move to their assigned seats. Delta and other airlines make traveling miserable. Poorly run. Any industry that loads from the front to the back is backwards anyway. And I have heard the reasoning for loading front to back. Only a fool actually legitimizes such explanations. Seriously. $79 to change a seat. To an unassigned seat just next to me. On a red eye flight.

At 5 pm the plane landed in Charlotte as it was diverted mid-flight claiming for passenger safety. Not sure how they didn't know they cant land in LGA before taking off. In Charlotte, they delayed planned take off for 3 hours, each time pushing it back by 1 hr increments as we sat on the plane. Finally at around 9 pm they announced the flight is cancelled as they don't have a co-pilot. It took another hour to collect our bags from baggage claim. In return they sent an apology and a voucher for a hotel in Denver. Finally this morning they sent another $50 voucher as if that makes up for anything and ruined our plans. I lost my hotel booking in NYC that was paid for. I had to pay for my hotel in Charlotte. I lost my Broadway show tickets. I also had to pay another $800 for a return flight from Charlotte to Denver because my travel plans were for one day only. During this entire time I was unable to get in touch with any customer support staff from Delta despite waiting on the phone for > 2 hrs. It was impossible to have any customer care representative contacted and they claimed it was due to high call volumes I was also trying to reach someone through text messaging starting at 9 pm. They got back to me at 3 am the next day waking me up from sleep. I have flown with Delta for many years and this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. You should be ashamed of treating your customers like this."
427,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Prague to Seattle via New York ,August 2022,2,1,,,1,2,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I've had the worst experience with customer service and missed my flight. I have beer in my luggage I wanted to bring back, on the delta app, they recommended paying extra at customer service for them to take special care of your bag. I get to the airport and there's not one single person at customer service for delta. There was also another gentleman looking for delta customer service, he had no boarding pass set on his phone. It took about an hour to have security call delta from the other side of customs, and was told to just bring the large luggage to security. There, I was getting integrated before security.  Then I head into security they unpacked, unwrapped, scanned and wiped nearly every item, taking another hour nearly. Also, no help getting my stuff back together in my luggage. Finally, they take my luggage to the plane, I quickly gather my belongings (shoes/phone/purse) and start walking down towards the plane tube and the pilot is walking back, towards me with my bag telling me I took to long and cannot fly. Security wouldn't even look at me after this, knowing it was partially their fault for taking their sweet as time, on top of not helping me put my stuff back together the way it was. The amount of times i was told ""sorry you took too long"" made me even more hysterical. I took too long? This all happened because you had zero staff upfront to check my bag! My flight was changed to the next day, no hotel accommodation ""because I took too long"". I ask them what they are going to do to make this right, I just got ""we're very sorry for the inconvenience, call a friend or family back home and ask for some money"". It's currently 2am back home. All my people are sleeping! I selected an isle seat when purchasing my ticket, and now have no say on where I sit for this next flight. If you want to be inappropriately interrogated, and told over and over that everything is your fault, and miss your flight due to lack of delta staff, you won't be disappointed. I'm a paying customer and this is how I am being treated?"

When I arrived in Seattle my connecting Delta flight (4053) had already finished boarding yet they held the doors open just a little longer because there was one passenger who had yet to arrive. I was that passenger. As I ran toward the gate I heard a voice call out, ""Are you AliceAnn? "" He seemed genuinely glad and relieved that I was going to be able to make the flight. I know they could have easily closed the doors and carried on, but they didn't. I can't tell you how thankful I am for the care and consideration the Delta employees gave me today."

And failed to reschedule our flight on top of her letting a another passenger in front of us that was after us on that list. On top of rolling her eyes at all of us. Nobody would help us.

By Sunday 2 of the bags made it to Augusta Regional while the other 2 were in Atlanta, about 2.5 hrs away. We were told the bags were going to be flown to Augusta since they have at least 4 flights a day to and from Atlanta. It is now Friday of the following week and our bags are headed to Paris. This is just the poorest customer support on the planet. If you plan to fly and come back empty handed fly Delta. You will not be disappointed."

Such a poor customer service. They said it was due to weather, so they won't provide a hotel, while there was a plane take off at the same time that my flight was supposed to. I had to book a hotel while I have only 230$ in my bank account. I came to Boston for an interview because I'm a student, hugely broke. I was very tired after my 5-hrs long interview. So I wanted to stay at a hotel. I was asking friends to send me some extra dollars so that I can stay at a hotel. What a irresponsible airline indeed. And I don't trust the airplanes got canceled because of the weather baloney. There was a thunder storm warning, yes true. But one flight decided to flight at the same time and other flight is not? I understand if you want to cancel the flight, but at least send an email notification. I will never fly with Delta again."

I'll also be letting anyone around me that is about to travel by air that the worst mistake for them to make would be to fly with Delta. They made everyone stand in line for at the bare minimum of 25 minutes while waiting for one flight attendant, causing the time for take off to be pushed way back. Our family knew time was of the essence so we asked if there was anyway the plane for our 2nd connection (that Delta switched up instead of a straight flight) could wait since we might be late along with others in our plane on the next connection. After we landed in Salt Lake City and got off the plane we ran as fast as possible to the gate that was supposed to be waiting for us and these people but nope, plane was closed for boarding and then a whole 7 hours sitting in the airport thanks to this excuse of an airline service.

Arrived and went through customs, dropped our bags with the Delta rep to be checked and put on our connecting flight for Spokane, Wa., checked the reader board and saw our flight had been canceled. After asking around the terminal we located the Delta desk area. The rep confirmed the flight had been canceled because they couldn’t get enough manning to work it. We were booked on the next days flight which is packed of course and I’m now seated separate from my wife? And there is no guarantee that flight will even make it and it now has a change in Seattle instead of going straight through. These people care nothing about the customer. We are now stuck in a city across the country from our home with no luggage and no clothing to change into after sweating in the 92 degree heat outside the airport. They deserve bankruptcy."

I then proceeded to argue with him whether 11:05pm after 10:45pm since you know, I can't board the second flight until another one lands. I finally got them, to their credit, to provide a room for the night and meal voucher. We land at our destination and I ask where the carry on bags are located because mine wasn't at the flight deck like they said it would be. I hadn't spoken a word when the Delta desk attendant said, ""do you have a question?"" To which I responded ""yes,"" and he curtly replied ""then what is it I can help you with?"" "

My son is 17 y old and he was flying alone from NYC to Vancouver. His flight got delayed, hours later cancelled. He was given an alternative flight which placed in situation to be completely alone at the airport overnight. I talked to 2 different representatives on the phone and they both dropped my phone call after saying: Don't worry. We will figure the best and fastest route for your son. Give us a few mins to review this. Conveniently, both of my phone calls were dropped after 45 mins being on hold. Delta did not support, help or accommodate him with anything. His flight following morning was again delayed by almost 3 hours. I understand The act of God situations and try to be as patient and understandable of situation. Delta air line dropped the ball on 17 year old child. I am disappointed and angry. There is a lots of parents working in airline industry and I am sure they all agree that we need to be extra vigilant about teenagers flying alone, especially those that are asking for help!"

Yet First on this old and noisy 757 was so cramped that I had to literally fold my 6'2"" into this seat (it's 37 inch pitch) which seemed literally insulting for First Class on a 5 hour flight. To continue the theme, on the LATAM code share connection from BOG to MDE (2 hours delayed) I ended up in actual coach, and not just that, in a random middle seat because neither Delta nor LATAM were able to reserve seats, and this even though the flight carried a DL code. Food on Delta was pretty good and the flight attendants caring. Still, overall not an experience I want to repeat."

I cancelled three tickets that I paid $3300. These were cancelled within 5 days of booking the flight. Delta would not refund the money but offered to give me e credit for the tickets. Even though I paid for all three tickets, they will only allow me the credit for the one in my name. Delta always begs the government to bail them out during bad economic times, but doesn’t seem to care about its customers when they need help. And yet they have the nerve to overbook flights and inconvenience their customers on a daily basis. To say I am disappointed with Delta is an understatement. Let the buyer beware. Don’t fly Delta."

We had first class seats. I turned on my cell phone and found an email advising that Delta cancelled my flight and automatically rescheduled my flight, not as a non-stop to Seattle which was supposed to arrive at 10.15 am, but as a flight to LAX, leaving at approx. 2.50 pm, changing planes after a layover, leaving LAX at approx. 7.30 pm and arriving in Seattle at approx. 9.50 pm. We were seated apart on both flights. There was a 2-hour delay in LA and we arrived at 11.45 pm. I got to bed at 1.45 am Seattle time, having been awake for approx. 26 hours. I incurred expense for the cancelled morning limo from home to JFK. I lost an entire day in Seattle with only two days planned. I have dietary restrictions that I brought to Delta’s attention in advance of the trip. That information did not carryover to either flight and I could not eat anything but nuts! Delta has no business over-scheduling flights if they don’t have crews or planes to fulfil their commitment to passengers. Spending all that money for first class to endure this on the first day of a long-awaited vacation is not just disappointing, it is unacceptable. We should be given a full refund for both flights. Delta's commitment to its passengers is a farce and I publish this story as a warning to those foolish enough to fly Delta."

By flight 16, our bags are very close to 23 kgs. A few pounds over which every single other carrier has let through due to immaterial difference. But not Delta. Tried to charge us 100 US per bag for excess baggage. Mine was over by 500 grams. Seriously. And then we were fed the most ridiculous justification for it - (not blaming the check in guy - he is just repeating nonsensical spoon fed information). But including small aircraft (our Qantas flight was a turbo prop Q400), needing to manage weight (redistributing into cabin bags still goes on the plane!) and needing to remain competitive advantage (really? By price gauging?). Anyway. No more Delta for us ever again. Pick all the other airlines I’ve listed."

We got complimentary drinks on the flight. On arrival we got expedient service at the counter to re book our flight free of charge. They even re routed our bags so we could have them. Which only took a couple minutes to retrieve! (Thanks baggage service!) Because of an overnight stay we were given a voucher for a nearby Doubletree (each of us our own room!) And a meal voucher for the hotel. Customer service was beyond exceptional even though they were clearly overwhelmed. In these difficult travel times even the flight staff were just beyond patient and collected. Thanks Delta!

There were only about 10 families in ahead of us at the airport, it took about almost 10 minutes for each family to check in and get the boarding passes. Furthermore, when we finally boarded, the seats weren't cleaned, the trash bags were missing. The pockets in front of us were filled with garbage.

Immediately opened a file for delayed baggage and was told that they would handle things and deliver my lost/delayed bag asap. Today is July 11th and I have not heard a word about my lost bag. I have called the number they give you if you don't hear from them 6 or 7 times, each time you call  you get warned that because of high volume your call may take up to 3 hours. So I've waited already as mentioned 6-7 times only to get the same run around, that they have no new information on my bag. Today I tried their messaging system, and after a bunch of questions and answers they said here call this #? Well it's the same # that puts you on hold for hours and then doesn't solve a thing. Basically you pay over 2k for a ticket, they lose your bags and now your stuck as they really don't do any effort to help you find your bags.  So now it turns out that they say you have to have receipts for everything if you want claim reimbursement. All in all I feel like Delta really doest even care if I ever get my bag back.  Never will fly with them again."

After a few minutes of sitting the crew informed us that they were waiting for a few people to board. About 3 people come and we finally taxi. The plane again stops and the captain mentions something about another delay. At this point they tell us they know we have connecting flights and will do all they can. We arrive 20 minutes late. The connecting flight was already boarding. We have 10 minutes to run from A74 to b24 about a 15 minute walk. I run with 2 minutes to spare. Guess what the gate closed early. Why did one flight wait and the other leave early. And why do they expect you to walk 15 minutes in salt lake city.

I normally do not write reviews but in this case the combination of gross negligence, incompetence and utter disregard for the ""customer"" deserves noting. My flight from Colorado Springs to Atlanta on July 9th was a series of delays and more importantly three mishandled interactions with the Diamond customer service representatives where my flight was changed without my knowledge or approval and a false representation where the agent stated a flight was cancelled as the justification behind the unilateral action when it was not (I watched it depart). Incompetence, deceit and unneeded chaos were the themes today - absolutely unacceptable!

I will watch movie later. 5 minutes later, I was informed thy are awarding me a certain number of the frequent flier miles for inconvenience. This is not the first time. They did it before for delayed and cancelled flights. Than I purchase $5 wi-fi, which worked flawlessly the entire flight. The entire crew was phenomenal in all classes. Pilots were informative. Pretty much they reported every single stormy cloud and updated us on the times of arrival to Atlanta. I cannot thank them enough for this outstanding service, pleasant flight and courteous service from check in to the boarding, flight and speedy bags on arrival, which is happen very often in Atlanta that bags come to carousel before I come from the gates.

464,1,,Business,Economy Class,Houston to Buffalo,May 2022,,,,,,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  In May of 2022 I had a Delta flight ticket. Flight was at 6:00 am. They had canceled the flight and sent a notification after 10:30 pm the night before where I already had gone to sleep. In the morning morning I received a notification that my flight is at 6:00am. I was a mile away from the airport in Uber I received another update that my flight is at 2:30pm. I was going to IAH to BUF. I decided to stay at the airport to take the changed flight. Flight was delayed several more times through the journey arriving at BUF nearly at MID-NIGHT (12:00am) where I was to arrive around 11:30am that morning. 2nd Issue: I bought another ticket from BUF to IAH in June of 2022. This time I had a conflicting schedule and could not fly that day and canceled the ticket 30 minutes after I purchased it for a full refund. I got a confirmation email saying refund confirmation request, then in another area of the DELTA App it says your case is being processed and refund should be in 7 days. I received a notification on Jun 20th of my flight being still active. I called Delta and they said it is being processed and there is nothing on my part to do at this time. Today I received a notification again that my flight is in 2 days. I called Delta again and this time the rep. tells me that I didn't cancel my flight and she just canceled it and sent a confirmation. As of today (7-3-2022) they are still holding on to my money since purchased in early June. I guess they mean it just like what they release in the toilet bowl daily.  I will never fly again with this airline. "

I did not stress at first as Delta had always done right by us flying. I called and the agent tried to charge us $175 each extra for a flight the next day together. After cancelling our flight and leaving us stranded in a foreign country. I ended up having to leave our last day early to taxi to the airport an hour away as we were in playa del Carmen. I lost money on our afternoon shuttle as well as the $50 cab fare and our last day in Mexico. So angry and disappointed. They blamed weather- on a beauty clear day that every other airline seemed to be able to fly on. Disgusting.

Always canceling flights just maybe 2 hours before flight needs to leave. I had a 22 hour layover. They just paid for my hotel. No meals or anything else. They then just gave me $15 for the 2 days I was held up in a hotel. 2 days after I get home no one could find my flight. I tried fighting on getting all my money back. After 30 mins of arguing I was on the flight they just gave me 10,000 points. Very disappointed. When we were waiting for our flight the first night, they gave us hot water and snacks were all sugar. I never got any money back from what I had to spend with food. Delta I will never fly or recommend your airline again. Use to be my favorite. "

Title of the review could be - Delta unethical practice of giving away your airplane seat - In January 2022, my wife and I booked tickets to fly to Paris in June 2022. One day before departure my wife received a text from Delta Airlines saying her seat in business class had been changed to a seat in the main cabin on row 33. Reason given in the text was change of flight schedule (which was not true) this was flight Delta 114. The price difference between the two seats was substantial but was not mentioned in the text. We tried to call Delta to understand the change but waiting time to talk to an agent was 2 hours, so we drove to Seattle airport to discuss at the airline counter. We went to Delta airlines and the Delta agent told us that we should discuss with Air France because the flight was booked through them. She also gave the true reason for the change and said, ""this happens all the time, we give priority to people with more seniority with the company (Delta)!"" So even though we booked our flight 6 months in advance we were booted from one of the seats a day before the flight because someone else needed it? We went to the Air France agent, and they told us they never do that (change a business class ticket for a main cabin ticket because someone need your seat). Air France staff was very professional and respectful, and we had to take another flight the next day with Air France."

We try to fly Delta when we can because of the great customer service. This trip we were very disappointed. I purchased the tickets at the same time, but Delta did not seat us together, I asked at the airport if they could correct this and was told no. Since we couldn't sit together, I decided I would spend the 5 hours watching movies. Well my tv monitor didn't work, after having it reset I was able to watch a movie and then it stopped working again. The people next to me had no problems with their tv. After landing my husband said the same thing happened to his tv. Once we landed we could not get off the plane because there was no one there to hook the plane up to the airport. We had to wait at least 30 minutes for someone to arrive. Finally we got off the plane and went to pick up our baggage. Our luggage didn't show up along with about 20% of the other passengers. There was a gentleman standing next to us and he said he had a tracker on his luggage and it showed it was still at the plane. People started complaining about our luggage not arriving. Shortly after they announce on the intercom that they had forgot a cart of luggage at the tarmac. Of course it was pouring outside and everything was getting soaked. After almost an hour wait we found out that they did send out luggage, but to a different location. They could have announced to us that they were sending it somewhere else. I am so disappointed in Delta, this was a terrible start for our vacation."

The Courier picked up the passports and delivered them to Delta where they were scanned in and put on the plan. The package was then delivered to Delta Cargo in Seattle where it was then scanned in. From that point I don't know what happened, but the passports are missing. My husband and I had to miss our 36th anniversary cruise, because the airline lost our passports. I have spent over 35 hours on the phone with Delta and gone by the Delta Cargo offices to try and find my passports. No one can help me and actually no one is even trying to help me. I can't get anyone I speak to have a supervisor to call, email or contact me, It makes no sense at all, everyone that I have spoken to says they can't have someone contact me. Why not?"

We knew it would be very close to make our connecting flight in Seattle to SLC. We ran from our gate to the connection, only to hear that the door had just closed and that we were too late. We walked away, catching our breaths, defeated and in despair. Just as the saddening news and the realization of what was to come in having to change all of our plans, Kevin (from delta) yelled down the gateway to us, asking if we had come from Calgary. With a nod from us he pointed us back towards the gate giving us the joyous news that we would indeed be allowed on the aircraft. I was informed that the lady at the desk had communicated with the tower on our behalf and string were pulled somehow to re-open the doors and allow us on the aircraft.

The hotel we were staying at was booked out and they were nice enough to allow us to stay an extra night in our same room. Unfortunately, our room was priced up to $1500 because their peak season started. We had no other options in that moment to look for another hotel in a foreign country at that hour, and there were no other rooms available. We submitted a complaint, got a case number. No one got back to us ever. Two months and hours worth of phone calls later I finally get someone to work the case, only for them to tell me that Delta has a max of $500 cap for extra stay. We understand the need for a cap, but there are always outstanding situations. We were not trying to have an extra free night of fun or take advantage, we had responsibilities pending, it was a total nightmare. This entire experience left us feeling like flying anywhere with Delta is a huge gamble now. No one is safe with these flight cancellations. Delta needs to figure out another way to take care of their customers and offset the out of pocket expenses that are unplanned due to these cancellations. If you don’t have the staff, don’t sell the seats!"

When we changed the city we were flying out of we had to change our return tickets as well and those were through American Airlines. They didn't charge us one cent to change our flights. The Delta airplane was filthy. Dirt and trash on the floor of the plane. Dirty hand wipes in the pockets on the seats. Filthy bathroom. The wifi didn't work. We will never fly Delta again.
478,2,,Business,Business Class,Seattle to Paris via Stockholm,June 2022,3,3,1,3,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Mobile App did not allow check-in. Did not show connecting flight. Did not provide information whom to contact in case you need assistance. I called the agent, wait was for 34 minutes. So, I opted for a call back. Did not hear from them in next 2 hours, while I was waiting at the check-in counter. Conclusion: Delta do not provide any assistance. Operations is the critical component of their business. I would care less if an airline avoids delays and disruptions (except in cases of extreme weather). For an international traveller, it is not east to navigate airports, or make alternative arrangements in a foreign country, that too in a situation where airport staff speaks language other than yours'. While booking the DeltaOne, my agent warned me that delta flights are often delayed. I gave it a shot nevertheless. And true to their reputation, Flight was delayed by 44 minutes in App, 1 hour at the checkin counter and 2 hours at departure. As First flight was delayed, I missed my connecting flight. The options I was given were: Fly by different carrier. But I have to claim baggage, go through security and checkin again. Catch is to do it in 1hour 15 minutes!  Wait at the airport for next flight (that was exactly after 12 hours and downgraded from business to economy).Leave my check-in bag with Delta and pick it up on return flight ! This made me really furious. I wonder if Delta and its partner has any sensitivity. So, I chose option b. And adding insult to injury, I was given 15 Euro complimentary food coupons. Talk about customer care. Delta is not transparent in their conduct or concerned about customer experience.  Ground Staff the most pathetic staff I ever witnessed.  The lady in-charge of ground affairs was outright rude. Did not even listen. I kept pleading for details, but she said she would help me later. I felt a bit arrogance in her attitude. And I did not understand where the staff kept disappearing intermittently. For two and a half hours that I was in checkin line (Sky priority is a joke), I noticed staff behind screen varied between 1 and 4. Perhaps Delta is short staffed. When I managed to reach check-in counter, the lady said I cannot check-in luggage as the deadline for baggage checkin is closed. So, either travel next day (which was not feasible for me) or take bag to the gate. Catch is, I had liquids in checkin bag. So, I had to throw them away. Remember, sometimes it is not about stuff but emotions attached to it. I had something special to me in the bag (Hence my resolve to avoid Delta as much as I can). The thing that made me furious is that flight stood at the gate for another 1hour 15 minutes after boarding completed. The most disgusting feeling was the way their staff looked at me when I showed I have DeltaOne. Perhaps, I did not look good enough for their ""Elite"" service. Delta's ground staff is indifferent, if not incompetent."

Airlines expect customers to plan for every eventuality but do not provide customers that same courtesy, like I don't know having backup attendants on call maybe instead of being as cheap as possible. This is very disheartening since the rest of the flight crew was on time without issues."

My experience began in Orlando with flight departing 2.5 hrs late due to ‘overloaded cargo bin’. Clearly missed connection. Arrived at complimentary hotel 0100 with no restaurant or food. I as several others was tired hungry and angry. All I wanted was ONE delta employee to apologize Treat me with grace and understanding. Additionally i was not provided a toiletry bag nor food voucher and i was too exhausted to think about it until i arrived at the hotel at 0100. Upon my return to my gate the next morning i did go to the help desk and request toiletries and food voucher which was provided. Come on Delta i encountered at least 8 different delta employees and not one treated me as a customer who deserves a smile.  People driven customer focused culture - I think not. You failed me and several others last night. You failed to see me. You failed to hear me. I pray you get it right for the next time. For me there will not be a next time with Delta. This has happened too often, you no longer deserve my business. I could share more of this journey if you care to ‘hear me’. Correction the pilot as we left the gate in Orlando apologized."

They told me I could cancel the 3 Delta flights and they would refund me $1800 so that I could apply that money toward my 3 Jet Blue direct flights. However, they only refunded me $183.04. I have reached out several times and their final response was as follows: ""Due to the write offs made on this booking to honor original rates, there is no additional compensation"" If they had told me from the beginning that I was going to lose out on money if I canceled the flights, I would have found a different destination. They told me they would honor my original prices and my travel agent conformed that she has that recorded. "

My flight got finally canceled after more than 3 hrs frustrating hours. The only compensation I got was $30 meal vouchers and a complimentary hotel Night that I didn’t use because the queue was so long and I got the email so late at night that I already booked the hotel. To make matters worse, I had to get a flight back home to San Juan that departed two days after with another airline. I won’t fly with Delta again in my life !"

My original nonstop flight would have only been 3 hours. My new trip in total will be 12 hours this is a huge east of my time. They also did not offer any compensation for this huge inconvenience! They canceled because they did not have a crew to fly the plane! I booked this flight 3 months ago and they couldn’t find a crew in that amount of time?

484,1,Boeing 767,Solo Leisure,First Class,Seattle to New York via Los Angeles,June 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,  This is by far my worst flying experience in my life and I’ve been flying since the age of 4 which is 40 years ago and I’ve flown with many international airlines across the globe. This airline is a joke doesn’t even qualify to be a budget LLC. I flew with them 4 sectors all in first class including delta one. First leg was SEA-LAX first class in a very old 30+ years old B737 after boarding and take off and the pilot switch off the seat belt sign I asked the notorious cabin crew if I can use the toilet and I was the very first passenger to use what’s supposed to be the first class cabin toilet and it was filthy and floor full of water and when I informed the FA he said yes it’s flooding. Prior to my departure Delta sent me via their app to choose my meals and since I have specific dietary requirements I choose what’s suitable for me. When the FA was offering the meals he came to me and with a very low and unclear tone he offered me what options they have and when I told him I have a special meal request he said we don’t serve that on domestic flights so eventually I took the oat meal with some shea seeds which turned to be an awful non edible option. After landing and waiting for my luggage I found my suitcase was damaged beyond repair I went to Delta luggage service desk I spoke with the employee who was very unhelpful and not interested to be working she just did a form and gave it to me with a tracking number and till today after almost a month still I didn’t hear from their customer service. My 2nd leg was from LAX-JFK supposed to be with B767-400 the newly refurbished delta one. As per Delta email prior to departure we need to be 2 hrs prior to departure at the airport which is 4am I was there on time and they said there is a dedicated lounge for delta one passengers . There was no one at the check in counters as they said they open by 4 am and to my surprise the Delta one dedicated check in lounge is just a partition of the check in area separated by a partition. We waited till 4:30am one one employee finally showed up and opened the partition and we did our check in finally. The only positive thing was the new delta lounge at LAX . Food options were horrible though. We boarded surprisingly to a very old dirty B767-300 with the old version of Delta one seats. Probably 25+ years old aircraft which was falling apart. Started taxing on time however for almost 1 hr the pilot was taxing around the airport and at 7 am he informed us we are going back to the gate as the plane developed a technical problem which need another hr of repair and we ended up sitting on board for another 2 hrs without even a glass of water or any interaction from the crew we eventually took off at almost 9 am 3 hrs behind our schedule and to my surprise the FA came to me and said you requested for a special meal and it’s ready so they actually serve pre ordered meals on domestic flights. Anyways we landed in JFK almost 3 hrs behind schedule at 5pm instead of 2:15 and I had to rush to catch my 7pm appointment which was so stressful with NYC traffic. The other 2 flights were nothing special LGA-BOS and BOS-DCA we’re both on old dirty EMB175 however we’re very short flights. Conclusion never again on this joke airline. And they say Delta is one of the best carriers in USA.

I've never experienced such cheek. Never again with this airline.  Das Personal an den Flughäfen ist unhöflich, nicht Kundenorientiert. Es gab nur Probleme mit den Flügen.

Only other option was to drive 15 hours, so we went to the Delta service desk, canceled rather than rebooked, and requested our checked bag to be returned to baggage claim. After spending two hours in baggage claim, speaking to an attendant for the second time finally yielded some information that the attendant apparently did none of the things he said he did, because our bag was already on another flight and our automatic rebook wasn’t canceled. Seven miserable hours of our lives we won’t get back, incompetence at every level from the employees, and still a bag on another plane with no help on retrieving it besides a 1-800 number with a 2 hour waiting line.

I open my tray table to discover there was food and crumbs and sticky stuff everywhere. I asked for it to be wiped off and the flight attendant handed me a 1 inch by 1 inch wrapped disinfectant wipe / we land at the airport and the start announcing that there are 80% of the flight that has connecting flights and we need to hurry. They drop us off in the middle of the tarmac and have us catch a bus to the terminal. We get to the gate and the door is shut and the time on the board says the plane is leaving in 20 minutes but the door is shut so we can't get on. I headed to the bathroom across the hall and by the time I get back I was told by my boyfriend that they came out and said they had room for 5 more. 5 loaded on and we were left behind to get shuttered to a hotel for the night, shuttered back to the airport in the morning. Delta could sell their flight tickets for a lot cheaper if they ran the business right but they have to charge more to compensate for all the double bookings, the hotel they have to pay for and travel they will reimburse because they can get it together. Then I get the text to see if that will help get us back on track and the only response I got from it was, ""my apologies I can only assist you in English"" I was speaking English! what a joke. "

490,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Daytona  via Atlanta,June 2022,2,5,1,,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  The day prior to our flight from Nashville to Daytona Beach was cancelled. We were placed on a much later flight that would set us to miss an entire day of already-paid-in-full vacation. We were able to change the flight to an earlier, similar flight. Baggage drop was difficult. We arrived to the airport 2.5 hours early. We also paid an additional $200 to book a hotel next to the airport to ensure this early arrival. This would not have been necessary if not for Delta’s cancellation of our flight. Even with staying at the airport hotel and arriving nearly three hours prior to our flight, baggage check took almost two hours. Despite so many cancellations, Delta staff did not seem to be moving with any sense of urgency for their travelers. Once on our flight, we were set to arrive in Atlanta and connect to a flight to Daytona. When we landed, we discovered that our connecting flight was cancelled midair. We did not receive any notification of this change- no text or call. After speaking to customer service at the ATL airport, we discovered that there was only one other flight to Daytona, our destination. Staff said that it may also be cancelled be we are welcome to select that flight. Ultimately, we were placed on standby for Orlando flights. We were able to barely catch the next flight out. Three Delta staff members assured me my baggage would follow me there. It did not. Since we arrived at the incorrect destination, the rental car company charged us an additional $500 to provide us with a rental car in Orlando. I created a baggage claim with Delta Baggage Claim Customer Service in MCO airport. ^he agent interrupted me often and was very short with me. It was poor customer service that I did not appreciate. She assured me that my luggage would be placed on a flight to either Orlando or Daytona and then delivered to my hotel. Several hours later, my luggage was placed on a flight to Orlando. It has now been at the MCO airport for hours. I cannot reach anyone about delivery. It will be a three hour trip there and back to retrieve my luggage. As for tonight, I have no toiletries or clothes. I cannot even brush my teeth, change my undies, or even swim in a swimsuit because I have no luggage. Delta should be embarrassed and ashamed. As a company, they should not be booking flights that cannot take off due to staff shortages. I am not looking forward to our return flights at all. I am honestly worried these flights will be cancelled as well. I feel that we should receive significant compensation for our difficulty and additional costs due to Delta’s poor travel management skills. If they cannot make this right and make it up to us, I will certainly never fly Delta. I will also be sure to spread the word as much as possible. "

Delta has been absolutely horrible to work with. No one was able to help us at the airport with rescheduling. Rather, we were giving a 1-800 number to call to reschedule our own flights. At 6:45 am I called Delta customer service. I was on the line for one hour and 47 minutes and during this time I did speak with an agent and she was not able to help us. She transferred us to her supervisor, and was disconnected after being on the line for almost 2 hours. We were still at the airport waiting to get rescheduled and still was told that no one could help us and to call the 1-800 number. I called back at 10:05 am and talked with another agent. I was on hold for one hour until I was told that she was not able to do anything, but would submit this to someone who was able to help us. Also, I was told a few times by customer service that there were over 2000 calls from customers that were waiting to be rescheduled and felt that we were one in 2000 and not that important. We were disconnected as well but she called us back even though Delta's protocol is to not call customers back that get disconnected from calls. Finally, by 2pm, our flights were finally rescheduled for the next day. This has been a horrible experience. Delta is awful to work with and I will never fly with them again. The fact that they had over 2000 people waiting on hold to get rescheduled and that I had to spend over 8 hours on the phone to get a flight reschedules is completely unacceptable. This is the worst customer service that I have ever experienced. Don't fly Delta!!"

On the way home Delta flew us to Atlanta, why I don’t know why! We Couldn’t land and not much fuel we were diverted to Columbia South Carolina to refuel. Fueled up and and had to wait 1/2 to get back into the skies, we landed in Atlanta to find the plane took off ten minutes earlier. Had to spend the night in Atlanta. The next day had to stay at the airport 4 hours to find out another delay for another two hours! Now we missed our flight at LGA! No clothes and no help! Never had issue in the summer with Jet Blue or American Airlines. I am never going through Delta again! Save your money or spend more to get a better airline!"
495,2,,Couple Leisure,First Class,Baltimore to Minneapolis,June 2022,3,1,1,2,2,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  We purchased First Class tickets but definitely did not receive First Class service. We were seated in seats 5C and 5D, the last row before comfort seating. For meal service we were offered one choice - WonderMeat burgers. Neither my wife nor I are vegetarians or vegan - my wife took one bite and said, ""Ick!"" I did not accept this non-choice and was offered a box with dried snacks and gummi bears! This is not First Class. If Delta cannot afford to offer all your First Class passenger a choice for meals, you do not deserve, and will not retain, your First Class passengers. Then, my video player did not work. This is a great example of ""shrinkflation"". Airline tickets today are 33% more expensive than this time last year, according to the WSJ. And yet, the service Delta provided on this flight was at least 33% worse than any other airline's First Class. Any of Delta's competitors would have done better than this. My conclusions - Delta Not First Class - we will definitely seek alternatives the next time we travel."

I had already checked in my luggage for the first flight and the lady at the counter ensured my luggage would be rerouted. However, when I arrived in Seattle after booking with a whole new airline (Alaska Airlines) because my new flight times were delayed 5 hours and I would’ve missed my connecting flight with Delta...my luggage was lost. I proceeded to make a lost baggage claim and Delta did not want to make a claim since I landed with Alaska. The lady at the counter lied and said it had arrived in Seattle but I forgot my Mac book (find my MacBook) was in my luggage and it never left Denver. Very unreliable and poor service, never flying with them again."

Their only excuse is “system”, ie things can’t be fixed because the system says they can’t, same system that added a random flight I’d never reserved nor paid for into my reservation, and caused my baggage fees to double because I need to pay extra for the flight I’m not taking nor have booked, from a place I’ve never visited. And it’s not the fault of staff. Poor things tried their best to help me, but their “system” and instructions basically left them helpless."

As an active duty military member I am able to ship my dog, and I had three agents verify everything was good to go. Show up for the flight and a member at the ticket counter stopped us after our bags had already been loaded and said he needed clarification on the regulation. He was on hold for over an hour, we missed our flight, and then concluded without reference that we would not be able to travel (I verified later that he was wrong). Because of that only half my family traveled while my daughter and I drove from SC to Cali in a rental. Days later I had to talk to three different reps (40 min hold time each) with none being able to get me a straight answer. After asking to talk to a supervisor, he finally confirmed that it was wrong and agreed to refund our follow-on flights. However, days later I have not seen the refund and was never sent the confirmation number. Do not trust this airline, will never fly with them again. Lost thousands of dollars with this that the military will not reimburse. Worst customer service I have ever experienced!"
500,4,Boeing 757-200 / 737-900,Solo Leisure,First Class,Sarasota  to Kansas City via Atlanta ,June 2022,2,5,1,5,5,,2,0,Not Verified ,"  Delta's non-international first class is to me, a waste of money. I travelled from Sarasota, FL to Kansas City International return and spent $293 extra for first class over the comfort plus seating. Both trips were via Atlanta. I had never travelled first with Delta, so thought I would give it a try. You get early boarding, but as your seat is designated, that is really unimportant. There are as much booze and hot/cold drinks as you want, but no food, only snacks. The second leg, ATL-KCI, was over 2 hours. Delta should serve at least a sandwich/yoghurt etc for that duration. As the journey is under 900 miles you are stuck with snacks. The seats on the Boeing 757-200 and 737-900 have no lumbar support at all and I found them very uncomfortable. Bring a pillow or inflatable cushion would be my advice. On the 737, I was at the back of first class and my seat had zero recline. It was all that was available when I purchased the ticket. I had 2.5 and 3.5 hour waits at Atlanta for the next plane and was hoping as I paid for first class, a lounge would be available. No such luck. You have to be an international traveller or own a special credit card, like Delta's own or I think, AmEx. On Delta's website, I could not find any info about lounge availability, so emailed them. I'm still waiting for a reply some 3 weeks later. I tried to call, do you really need me to tell you the wait time? It's true you have 21 ins of seat width and 37 inch pitch. But for a lot less money, $293 in my case, you can get Comfort Plus with 34 inch pitch and 17.2 inch width. Very disappointed with value for money, I would not waste my time paying for this seat, you may think differently of course."
501,1,!,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Oslo via Salt Lake City,June 2022,,,,,,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  We booked our original flights 9 months ahead of time in order to obtain a late morning flight time with reasonable layovers from Phoenix, AZ, to Oslo, Norway. Four months later, Delta then changed our original flight time to 5 hours earlier for no apparent reason - with very long layovers. We immediately called Delta so try to fix this, but were told to wait until 2 months before our trip started to rebook to a later start time, and that changing the start time would require yet another phone call - which we did. After 35 minutes on hold for the 2nd time, the agent couldn't rebook our flight using Delta's internal computer system - for some strange and unknown reason - so were transferred to Delta's ""Manual Servicing"" department. And we were told that changing to a later time - which was very close to our original start time - ""may"" result in incremental charges of over $400 for each of the two flights we were trying to change back to original. 60 more minutes on hold with the ""Manual Servicing"" department - then we were disconnected. We gave up. - never got the problem sorted."
502,1,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Northwest Florida Beaches via Atlanta,May 2022,5,5,4,5,1,5,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  The first leg of the flight from DFW to Atlanta was nice. My husband and I landed a few minutes early, however, once we stepped off the plane, everything changed. We endured the worst airport experience ever in our combined 109 years. We had 1 hour to deboard and take the train to another terminal to catch our connecting flight to Panama City, FL (ECP). After rushing to get to the other terminal, we were disappointed to see on the screen that our flight to ECP had been canceled. About that same time I received a text from Delta that due to the inconvenience, they would provide us with a complementary hotel room from a list of hotels they provided and a complementary meal. I attempted to reserve a room at one of the hotels provided, only to find that all within 30 miles of the airport were booked. We made our way back to the main terminal and proceeded to stand in a long and winding line at the ticket counter. By this time, it was about 10:30 pm. While waiting in line, I checked the Delta website for the next flights going to ECP. There were no more flights that night, all flights the following day were sold out, and all were sold out two days later except for the late flight that had a few seats remaining. I called Delta Customer Service thinking this may be quicker than waiting in line at the airport, however, the wait time to speak with a CSR was 3+ hours. After waiting in line for over 2 hours and next in line, a Delta staff member walked by the line and asked what we needed. I explained our situation that our connecting flight was canceled, according to website all flights were sold out the next 2 days and none of the complementary hotels had rooms available and was told ""you'll have to wait until next week to get to FL."" About that time, another Delta staff member said they were closing the line down because it was past time for them to go home. We proceeded to the baggage area and waited another hour in line to get our bags and were advised we could not get them that they would be on the 8 am flight to ECP and we could get them whenever we got to ECP, By this time it was 1:30 am. We had to find our own hotel and transportation ($230 + $60 to hotel + $30 from hotel) and planned on renting a car and driving so we didn't lose 2 more days of our vacation. After getting 3 hours of sleep, we returned to the airport and stood in line at Dollar Rental for 2.5 hours before deciding to go back to the airport terminal to see if they had any seat cancellations to ECP or other airports within 2 hours. We waited in line 2 more hours to finally get a Delta staff member who actually was trying to help. She was able to get me on a late afternoon flight and my husband on a flight that evening. I received a $100 credit from Delta for the inconvenience (my husband did not) and $15 voucher for a meal. But, considering we spent $320 on the hotel and transportation to and from hotel, and lost a day of vacation, we are out several hundred. Not to mention I canceled the return flight and rebooked on SW and only received a partial credit. Although I realize there is a shortage in pilots and many flights are being canceled, there needs to be a process set up to ensure those whose flights have been canceled are rescheduled on flights as soon as possible, instead of standing in line after line and not getting anything accomplished. Most importantly, staff in ATL need training on what customer service is, specifically, courtesy and professionalism."

The female manager told me I cannot board because I need to be there at least 15 minutes before boarding. We conversed and she was very hostile. After about 10 minutes of this the doors closed. She then said once doors closed I cannot board. I said they just closed now. She gave me the best flight at 448 which was fully seated unless someone didn’t show up. I stayed there and luckily one person didn’t come. 8 min before take off I said can I board since he is not here? The same female said no I’m still going to wait for him. I then said but I arrived 12 min before and you didn’t allow me. She ignored me and then told me I cannot board and the last flight is canceled. This was the worse and most unprofessional airline I have ever been on and I will never be flying with them again!

I checked into that flight, show up to the airport to find out that flight was also canceled after sitting in line for almost 2 hours, and I was told there was nothing that could be done. I was flying out to Connecticut to purchase an RV. I had the party waiting to pick us up and to make the purchase. I needed to explain that my flight was canceled again after arranging the pickup time again with them due to the first canceled flight. I have still not received my refund for my brother nor me. I was told that my refund would go back on the same form of payment, which was my credit card. As of right now I have not received a refund, I will end up paying interest on a flight that I never got to take and I looked very stupid to the party I was purchasing the RV from. I am sure they thought what a fraud I was! I have filed a complaint, I have filled out a refund form and have received no communication back.

I found a flight with a shorter layover leaving later in the day at half the price I had paid round trip. When I tried to change the flight myself the app and website kept timing out. I contacted delta to have them switch my flight manually, providing screenshots showing the price along with a screen recording as well. I was told that there was a different price on their end and would not honor the price on their own website / app. Complete false advertising. On top of that one of the supervisors I spoke to was so incredibly rude. She told me they could not honor the price as the connecting flight was through virgin Atlantic (a sky team member).

I experienced the most devastating trip with the Delta Air Lines. They canceled our flight without providing any reasons with a short notice of 5 hours prior to departure. They booked us with an alternative flight for the next day which did not work for us since our work obligation needed us to come back home the same day. I started communicating with an agent online and requested to rebook us with an alternative flight to arrive home the same day. They rebooked us with a different airline. They did not provide any confirmation number or ticket number until I requested them. We went to the SAN airport feeling happy that we successfully rebooked our flight. When we checked the ticket number that Delta provided us online with the new airline we realized that they booked us with a flight with no room! We checked again with Delta at the airport, and without receiving any apology, they tried to book us with another available flight. I asked them now that you booked us with a different airline, how can I ask to reimburse the fees that I paid for baggage check in and seat selection yesterday. They responded that you may request online after the trip is completed. We nearly spent 12 hours at the airport/flight until reaching home for a flight that suppose to take 3 hours. Our baggage was lost and it took us three days to receive it. Then I started processing the reimbursement for the baggage and seat fees with Delta that we have never been provided due to the flight cancelation. I could not pull up the information online and get my e-receipts online using my confirmation number upon arriving home! I had to go to the airport and inquire there. I spent nearly 5 hours at the airport to speak to an advisor which eventually she told me that they are unable to support me since the trip is completed unlike what they promised at the time of departure. They provided me a phone number for care assistance. I called them at least 5 times each time waited on the phone between 2-3 hours to be supported. They asked the ticket number and asked me to stay on the phone for a short while which took forever and they hanged up from their end! I would never ever considering travelling with the Delta Air Lines and I highly recommend the travelers to read the reviews online and think twice before booking with this flight."

They cancelled my first flight with no notification. None. Called the Delta helpline, 3 hour wait. The wife stayed online while I got to the airport to try to talk to an agent. None of this worked so had to book with a different airline at a higher cost. Delta refused to pay the difference, which I understand business model you would be losing money if you took care of the customer. They gave us a 100 dollar credit to fly with Delta again, while we spent over 300 dollars more to get to where we were going. The kicker, it happened on the way home as well. I’m guessing it will be the same result. Some sub-par compensation for a terrible experience."

It's stuck in Detroit and I may never see it at this point. I was told it would be expedited and hasn't when they finally located it. I've called every day and been into the airport in person and the most they would do is message the airport, when I asked if they could call as I need my things, they told me I had to call myself as they could be bothered. Worst customer service ever. I may never get my back at this point, or if I do it definitely won't be within a week of when it was actually supposed to arrive. If you use this joke of an airline, carry on or you may never see your luggage again."

My daughter was flying home from Albuquerque to Hawaii where she is a student with her service dog. Hawaii requires a veterinarian note on a certain day to arrive or the dog goes to quarantine, which would have ruined him as a service dog. Due to Delta incompetence the connecting flight was missed, Delta would not put her on a different flight or airline. I had to buy her a last minute $700 ticket to get home from another airline.

The flight attendants never came around to see if we needed anything. I watched the flight attendant sleep throughout almost the entire flight through the screen (pic attached). I wish I could get paid for sleeping on the job. The pillow others and myself received were not sealed in plastic and were used and dirty, and the blanket was a tablecloth. The food was so bad, TV dinner I would toss in the garbage if I was home. If you wanted a snack or a drink (barely any options), you were told to retrieve it yourself. When I asked if there were more than three snacks to choose from, which were pretty bad, the flight attendant told me that's all the airline would give them. Delta Air Lines really needs to step up and treat their customers as if they care about them."

My flight from Reno was cancelled with no notice. Employee Lie #1-you should have received an email about cancellation. Employee Lie #2-there is only one flight leaving tomorrow, so you're stuck till then(there were, in fact other flights later in the day with other carriers-which they booked for me after spending 30 minutes on the phone). Employee lie#3-you'll have plenty of time to make your connection. LAX will have you leave the terminal and go through security to get to your next gate-missed my flight. Employee Lie#4 and 5-we will refund your AMEX card, but you can only call about it after you have completed your flights, so nothing gets messed up on your present flight.(your contract actually states that once you complete a flight, no refunds will be given). I was told this two times by two different employees, so it counts as two more lies, and clearly demonstrates the policy is to lie about refunds, so they have their ass covered once you take the flight. Lie#6-we have re-routed your bags to Atlanta so you will have them when we put you up in a hotel for the night(an honest baggage specialist explained the fact that isn't even possible, once they are checked, they go to your final destination) Lie #7-just go to customer service after you ""get your bags in Atlanta"" and you'll get a hotel voucher. ""I put a note in the system"". Nope, bags aren't here and customer service doesn't know what you're talking about. Finally, a kind soul baggage specialist took pity, and picked up the phone to the local hotel, and said ""we have another one"", and got us a hotel. For all my trouble, spending 36 hours instead of 6, being routed literally all over the United States, losing over $1500 in extra costs and lost wages. I get some vouchers for free Delta Flights!"

They moved our first flight to 7am and our last flight to land in Ohio at 5pm. Not only that, but they also split my husband and I up in the process of consolidating for their convenience.

The earliest they could fly me home was 26 hours later and they made no attempt to find me a different combination of flights to get me back same-day. They also denied paying for an extra day at my hotel, a rental car or anything to accommodate my extra time in FL citing their “inclement weather policy”. American Airlines can fly me back through the same connection city today, though, so clearly weather isn’t too much of a concern for them. Very poor customer service and general cancellation policy, I won’t be flying with them again."

They missed my connection 2 days ago, and I’ve been living in the NY airport ever since. Luckily my luggage was forwarded on home somehow. Which means I’m wearing the same underwear I was when I left. Bumped from every flight til the last one of the day each night. Which then gets cancelled right before they close for the day. But at least they let you sleep on the floor while you wait for the next shift to start. No help or advice from any of the staff, other than a $15 voucher for the airport at the end of each night. But the food options close up about the same time you get the voucher. Never thought Delta could make Spirit look like they have their act together."

We looked for the Gate Number, it said ""Cancelled""? (there were no problematic weather conditions) I went over to the Delta desk. The agent told me it had been cancelled but he did not know why. I asked him what we should do, He said ""Call the Delta 1 800 number"". We did and waited over an hour, we finally got an agent and their best offering was an American Airlines flight on Monday at midday. (2 days later!). No reason given, I saw that Delta had cancelled another flight that same afternoon. Young families were left stranded. I ended up booking a flight myself on Southwestern Airlines the next day. No Notice via email or text, No reason given, No help provided at the airport. A disgraceful treatment of passengers."

Same thing next day. We got “oh well” from front desk staff we did what we could. We are working people with schedules just like all the other travelers Delta did this too.

545,1,,Couple Leisure,First Class,La Guardia to Milwaukee,May 2022,4,3,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Sad to say that Delta isn't alone with their poor customer service. Today I realized that I would get to my destination too late to pick up my dogs. I wanted to move a first class ticket on a 3 PM flight to any class in a noon flight. I first tried online. the Delta site said that a flight change needed to be handled on the phone. I called the number listed - and the wait for an agent was 3 hours. That was understandable a year or two ago, in the midst of COVID panic, but now that flights cost 3 times more than they did then, one would think that hiring customer service agents would be a priority. Speaking of priority, it shouldn't matter but I've had my 'sky priority' membership for over 25 years. So I go to the airport, to the gate where the flight from LGA to MKE was in the boarding process. Great! Nobody is at the counter, where two attendants are standing, one who is talking on the phone and laughing. I ask the other one if I can get on the flight, changing my full cost, first class ticket to any seat in the plane. She says 'I don't know. You have to ask that person', pointing to the gate for a flight to Bangor Maine, where one person was in front of a line of 10 people. I walked over to the line but it was clear I'd never make it in time. I walked back to a Delta service counter - a huge line with two agents behind the counter. My wife they tried to speak to the agent at the MKE gate, and she waved her away and said 'too late!' No 'sorry, we can't now' or 'let me see what I can do'. I had looked on the app saw that there were seats available - even two in first class. I used to always insist on Delta for any flight. They are just as bad as the worst airlines out there - even for long-time customers who are willing to pay for a fully refundable ticket. And their flight attendants complain about 'respect'?"

Cancelled our flight just 4 hours before departure. Rebooked for the next day. Desk staff were unable to provide anything other than a 15$ meal voucher. Manager was unable to provide a hotel voucher despite the cancellation resulting in an overnight stay because the next earliest flight was the next day. Fast forward to the next day, go to check bags. Rebooked flight was with another carrier. The partner carrier can’t check the bags to the final destination because Delta has to release the ticket to them. Proceed to wait over 30 minutes with customer service in order to get a rep so we can get our bags to our final destination. A true nightmare of a travel situation. Do not fly Delta. Their customer service is slow, disorganized, and provides too little help, too late. Their operations are just as chaotic and the one who suffers the most is the customer."

I informed him that our final destination is Poland which does not have such restrictions or requirements on this date of travel. I verified that with Department Of State official website. He checked with colleague and insisted that our transfer in Paris have such requirement - European Union. I argued that we are not going to France. We are not leaving the airport. It is transit only. He did not change his denial of our boarding passes. In desperation we hired Lyft, went to two Walgreens locations and $ 357.86 later came back to the airport with negative PCR COVID test results.

The flight was overbooked, yet again, and it was delayed by almost 2 hours. They wouldn’t even share with guests why the flight was delayed when the weather was perfectly fine and there were no storm warnings. The planes are so little that no one is actually allowed to bring a carry-on bag, not literal but we were forced to put our carry on bags under the plane. A flight that was supposed to leave at 5:45 left at 8pm ! This was such a drag but Jeff - one of the flight attendants, was super nice and friendly.

We soon ""had"" to head to the gate where we waited another 20 min to get a sky bridge operator. Once we got off the plane they noted crew rest issues and the flight would have to be canceled. They told us to head to customer care which I did, where I waited 6 hours to talk to someone. The only option was a flight the next day at 6pm. Mind you it's already midnight. The staff could care less about customer care. We were provided nothing and was told it is what it is. My wife and I slept on the floor of a dirty airport terminal with no blanket or any accommodation.

Following on from this they closed our ticket so we had to pay our own fare back to Manchester on the train and we were told that ‘Delta do not cover these costs’ I am appalled by their service, staff and attitude towards customers they are by far the worst airline I’ve ever dealt with I will never fly on a delta flight again.

It pains me to say this, but I have never had a worse experience than I am having today with Delta. As a platinum medallion sky miles member everything is normally great and enjoyable. Not today. Delta had an equipment malfunction on the plane today, set the flight back several hours, we were never given any updates, and after 5 hours of sitting around they canceled the flight with no other routes available today. They pretty much trapped hundreds of people in the airport, I am now forced to sit around 15 hours for the new flight tomorrow morning (no exaggeration, I am delayed 15 hours due to their equipment malfunctions). No hotel voucher, no care or service, I have never felt more stranded, held captive, and abandoned all at once. Delta is horrible, and their service and handling of such issues is atrocious. I am stranded in one of the biggest cities with no hotel, no back up route to leave on, and they are holding my bag in the cargo hold so I can not even get it and drive to my location. Delta's service has never been worse, and this is the most absurd event I have ever been part of. If you want to get some where on time, do not use Delta. This has ruined an important business trip, and I am never going to use Delta again."

Since this is in the middle of the event we were attending in Chicago, it means we have to rebook for the next day, pay for an extra night in the hotel plus meals. We have been Skymiles Medallion members for years, and this is how they are treating us now. If the numbers don’t make for a flight, then the passengers are left up a creek.

I have flown Delta as well as other airlines dozens of times in my military career and for personal travel, but have never experienced flights being cancelled without a valid reason or had flight attendants be rude to passengers. When leaving from Spokane Airport the women working the counter at Delta were unprofessional and were clearly irritated that we were checking in for our flight. We were the only ones standing in line, 3 women were at the kiosks, but none of them wanted to call us up. Finally, after they all looked at each other, one of them called us up, but was unpleasant with us. I will make sure to never book future flights with Delta."

Was supposed to be a two hour flight, we didn't land until 7:40 and weren’t allowed off the plane until 8. Our second flight was scheduled for 9:20 (after a delay thankfully). We thought because of the delay we would make the plane but it got pushed back to 12am and then cancelled. We were reschedule for a flight the next day but that got cancelled as well without any notification. Thankfully we were watching the app. We went to the flight rescheduling stand and they were pretty difficult to work with. We decided to try driving home but all the rental car were taken. We ended up having to take uhauls home instead. Will not be recommending Delta or for people to fly through JFK. "

No lounge access at PTY, no priority security, rude on the ground staff at PTY, old equipment with circa 1990s IFE. Simply can't imagine why anyone would actually pay for this (yes I did). This wasn't a first-class experience, not even a second class experience, very much a third class experience. Don't really understand why people think Delta is so great. As a OneWorld Elite, I won't be returning to Delta anytime soon."

DTW to CDG on the A350 the service was okay. At the start the Delta one person in charge came over and told us the crew for the area will take good care of us. Seemed a lie because when the service started it was the same crew for us as for economy class. The meals are served on a plastic purple plate in foil tins. Meals nothing great but tasted fine. Breakfast was served 1hr prior to landing in CDG. Not sure why Delta wouldn't carter a McDonalds original egg muffin with sausage as it is much better and probably cheaper. Not worth in Premium R to Europe nothing is different but getting Sky Priority, and headset and the amenity kit. Delta would have to add lounge access to make it worth while. It seems only the routes to Korea get good food in proper plates. plus service. On the return from CDG to SLC was on a A330-900 Neo. The food was horrid, and one cannot imagine why Delta would cater such food out of Paris. Considering they cater sandwiches for the snack available at anytime which were much better plus the hot cookie. Instead of complaining about Emirates and Qatar Airways focus on the food services and dedicated service in Premium R to compete with them. Premium R should have dedicated crew that is not working economy class and seats that recline more maybe to 175D. Till Delta fixes those issue then Premium R is a joke even if you get at dirt cheap miles."

Then already filled the other planes going to Idaho falls on other airlines and the next one to leave isn't until 2:45. They gave us some tiny biscuits and waters but now I'm forced to go pay my life savings away for some terrible airport food. No compensation, no meals, no nothing. There should be something returned to the customer. It's completely ruining our trip and now I'm missing all my classes and day off work. All because we couldn't complete a tiny 45 minute flight."

Delta manager requested us to answer some questions, but when we asked him some questions he never replied, always giving us the same sentence. He said we had to speak with Delta and not with him, when he was the manager in charge of Delta. We were being ignored and they made fun of us from 11am until 2pm.

573,1,,Business,Premium Economy,New York to Indianapolis,May 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified , New York to Indianapolis. This was literally the worst flying experience I have ever had in my life and I’ve been flying since I was two years old. First off they cancelled my flight without giving me any type of notification at all. I just arrived at the airport and the ticketing agent is the one who informed me as I was trying to check in. I also prepaid to check a bag that the ticketing counter told me I’d be better off not checking in because of all the changes they were having. So I paid $30 for a bag that didn’t even get checked in. So I tried to see if there were any flights that would be arriving to Indy earlier because even though I work I am also a mother to 6 year old daughter who was expecting me to be home early afternoon who I would be disappointing immensely because of this to which I was informed that there were no flights and I would just have to endure the long day. After enduring the additional 8 hours at the airport it’s finally time to check in and get on the plane. As I’m going through I am literally forced to check my bag in due to “lack of space” on the flight. So the bag I spent $30 to check that I was told to not check because of all the changes I’m given no choice to check in. I was almost in tears at this time because I was expected in hours ago and it seems that regardless of what I want Delta and their employees plus care less. It is very evident that Delta doesn’t give the slightest iota for the people who fly for them. I will literally never fly with this company again it was the only part of my entire trip and I regret using Delta rather than my normal airline. Lesson learned on Delta flights your just a number not human being.
574,7,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Elmira,April 2022,5,5,,,2,,4,1,Not Verified ,"  I am 80 years old, I am able to walk, but have trouble walking long distances especially when I have to walk fast. I like flying with Delta because I like the airport in Elmira, which is 2 hours from home. My problem was coming back from Las Vegas. The plane left on time, no problem. When we got to Detroit, we were a little early, not much, but we were early. We were not able to get to our gate because something was parked in our way. It was announced that we had to wait for someone to move the vehicle before we could deplane. I was going to ask the stewardess for a seat closer to the front of the plan when I got on, because I only had about 45 minutes to get to my connecting flight to Elmira, NY. I noticed the plane was full so I didn't bother to ask. We waited approximately 10 minutes before the plane could get in its spot for passengers to deplane. According to my ticket I had approximately 45 minutes to get to my new gate for Elmira, NY. Now 10 more minutes had passed, so now I had 35 minutes to get there. Of course I was towards the back of the plan so that was about another 10 to 15 minutes. My daughter had requested a wheelchair assistance for me because I have trouble walking long distances. It was on my ticket for Service request: Wheelchair requested. When I finally got off the plane there was no wheelchair for me. There was another lady there in a wheelchair. I told the lady behind the desk I requested the wheelchair and she said just have a seat that one would be coming. I told her that I had to catch another flight in about 20 minutes and she asked me what time the flight was. I told her and she said "" Oh they are probably gone by now."" I asked her if she could call the gate that I was suppose to go to and she said just have a seat. I was anxious and I said I need to get to my gate. She said to me "" Don't yell at me"". I said I wasn't yelling and that I was concerned about making my flight. About that time a young attendant showed up with a wheelchair but he was assigned to another lady. I said could you please take me to my gate so that I don't miss my flight. He said he was only assigned to the other lady. He saw that I was upset and he said "" OK I will take you too. She we left gate A72 or gate A76 ( I am not sure) and my new gate was B2. When we got down to the tunnel for B he told his supervisor that I had to make a connecting flight to B2 and then the supervisor said it was okay for him to take me. This young boy was a little miracle for me and when we got to Gate B2 the plane was already loaded and I don't know if anyone called them to say that I was coming or not, but they greeting me very friendly. I got to my seat and minutes later we were in the air. I will fly again with Delta, but I feel there should be more time between connecting flights because of the distance between gates, especially if person has to get to a distant gate from where they landed. I still have my tickets if the Airline wants to contact me to verify what I have stated."

Flight was rescheduled 10 hours after original flight. For spending the night in an airport and taking 10 hours of my time for a management foul up, Delta wants to offer me a $75 dollar flight voucher. $75 for 10 hours! That's not even minimum wage. What an insult. I have flown other airlines in the past. There are going to be problems from time to time, but the other airlines knew how to better apologize for their mistakes.

I wish I had an option and they weren’t the only airline that flies out of my town. Their “cheap” tickets are not cheap. You still pay $200- 300 plus on average for one way, you don’t get mile points for the basic economy, you can’t change flights, oh you also have to pay $99 to just cancel the flight, and no refundable. Won’t even give an e-credit to your account. Nearly, every time I fly with them they overbook the plane and people have to be asked to fly another time or day, I’m so over it. I hate how many scam and fraud airlines there are."

We boarded the plane with excitement! It was an all-around horrific experience. The flight attendants were rude. The tv screen did not work. The drink I ordered was not available. This is all minor, compared to the supposedly 4 + star resort that we arrived at. It was more like a 1-star resort. Very outdated. Very rude staff. The amenities were mediocre. The food was awful, we both got sick! We could not even go to the beach, there were so many horses and horse manure, it smelled awful! Delta basically laughed at me and said they were 3 months from returning emails. I called and told them my concerns! They offered me $100 credit, per person. I paid over $4000 for this vacation. It was a horrible experience. I am just glad we made it out of there alive. I have never been more thankful to get back from a vacation. It was a terrible experience all around. I will never fly Delta again."

My father recently passed away and I was left with choice of flying across the country. If I had known just how much this company does not care about it’s customers I would not have flown with Delta. I was the next of kin and without being in the same state as the incident I needed to be there before I could provide information like the funeral home so I could receive the bereavement fare. I could not provide such information so in return I had to pay $320 for a flight. It’s absolutely disgusting the way customer service has treated me in regard to reaching out about help with the flight. They had the audacity to ask me to pay for a new flight instead. This is disgusting behavior.

I have been a Delta Skymiles member for many years and I will never fly with them again. First they cancelled the connecting flight from Atlanta to Provo because they didn’t have a pilot. I had to change my whole itinerary to leave the next day and arrive back a day later. Not to mention needing another covid test and travel clearance again to fly to my destination. On the way back to JFK, apparently they never cancelled my return flight from the previous day to the following day and I had to wait for over an hour for a Delta representative to even pick up a phone and correct this mistake. The women who was handling my problem was very rude and seemed bored by the whole problem. As I said earlier, I will never fly Delta again."

Our flight was initially delayed due to plane not being available so they pulled a plane had just completed the annual maintenance. We were delayed again due to de-icing and needing to wait for winds to die down so they could use the lift to de-ice. In the air, they announced we would be delayed due to need to land to re-fuel. On the ground in Great Falls. ID we waited for gas until they announced we had issue with crew timing out so we would need to stay overnight. We waited in line for well over a hour to find out we needed to eat on site to use food voucher. We waited 1.5 hrs for shuttle to hotel and when we arrived the hotel did not have any rooms (thankfully Hilton put us up at another Hilton property). We arrived back at the airport the next morning (6am) as instructed and waited around until they announce our plane (just out of annual service) had issue with hydraulics so we needed to wait for part and for someone who could fix. We than were told we had to wait as the plane was low on hydraulic fluid and the truck had to go and get some more. We boarded and finally arrived at our destination 23 hrs later. For all of this Delta gave us $75 voucher - no words for how crazy that is. I requested a voucher for the cost of our tickets but waiting to hear back."

586,1,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Denver to Barcelona via New York,April 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ," Denver to Barcelona via New York. Delta has a series of automated systems and policies that leads the consumer to be screwed out of the seats they spend time and money to select. My fiance/hubby and I flew to Europe for our Weddingmoon, meticulously planning our travel to avoid issues. Only to find, on our 19 hr travel days, that our seats had been changed on both the departure and return flights - this gave me a migraine on the way there and separated us on the way home. No one on their staff can ever help solve problems so you pay extra to have them do whatever their system wants, while ""tying"" the hands of their employees. Not to mention the horribly uncomfortable seats and unhappy flight attendants. Received nothing but unhelpfulness, and so we will never fly with Delta again. Giving my money to better businesses."

We are both skymiles medallion members and fly Delta whenever possible. I ran into a few Delta flight attendants at a Charleston hotel — they were standing to the side of the check in stand, so I thought they were waiting on their room to be ready. The front desk lady waived me over, so I headed up to check in. After I checked in, the delta flight attendants rudely proclaimed “we were actually waiting before her”. I felt bad and apologized and explained I thought they were just waiting to the side. Instead of just letting it go, they rudely rolled their eyes. I was very disappointed in their attitudes, especially in uniform! Makes me rethink our loyalty to delta."

You cannot reach a human being by phone to request a flight change or anything else for that matter. The online chat is not with a human but is an automated and completely nonresponsive auto messaging system. When the system said it would connect me to a human, I am still waiting after 15 minutes. No telling when if ever a real person will actually chat with me. In short, Delta seems happy with booking people on flights but is unwilling or unable to provide any degree of customer support. Airlines as poorly run as this should go out of business."
591,7,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Albany to Ft. Lauderdale,March 2022,4,4,3,3,3,,3,1,Not Verified ,"  I would like to say Delta was always my airline of choice. They have great customer service. Mostly because of Covid I planned my trip by train the rides (round trip) were canceled do to Covid and related personnel issues. So, the price was much higher for this round trip to Florida than anticipated. It was a little tricky to get Delta for every flight. We all hear the news about mask wearing. There are two sides to every story as they say. I have always followed the rules. So, of course I wore my mask with some discomfort. Most people complied with this law for mass transit. I did notice many airline personnel without masks. I am one to mind my own business; but I believe you lead through example. My main problem with flying anymore is the long lines-hurry up and wait. I do have metal implants that can set off security alarm systems at courthouses and airport. I also mention this. So, of course I had to be patted down. i do not like this procedure, but wanting to complete my travel plans i complied. I carry prescriptions that can easily show up on x ray, but most of the pills I carry are holistic supplements. I am sure that my ""misplaced"" luggage was no accident. This has happened to friends in the past and to my husband several years ago( Delta for sure). So, it is my belief airlines are too interested in our personal belongings. Anytime a bag was lost or delayed that said luggage contained medicine, both prescription and holistic. Air travel is very expensive and keeps going up. The inconvenience was just too much during this last trip. In my opinion Delta has higher standards than the other airlines. If i have to travel by air again I know I will choose them. Upon arrival back into Albany in March we took an awful bump upon landing. The flight was from LaGuardia to Albany around five in the afternoon. I have flown often in the past and many international flights. That was the worst landing I ever experienced.  If Delta or any airlines wants to keep customers flying they have much work to do. Thank you for reading this."

593,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Panama City, Panama to New York City",April 2022,1,4,1,5,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," I’ve never been treated like less than a human being more than when speaking to Delta employees. I was trapped in Panama, after arriving to the airport 3 hours early to my flight. They refused to let me check my bag, which I was fine with, I was even about to throw out the whole bag. After saying this they then proceeded to tell me I cannot board my flight, and could not give me a legitimate reason as to why. The exact words I was told was “oh well you should've got here earlier. She told me she could book me a new flight for the next day and said the price would be $400 when online the same exact flight was $144. She then handed me a piece of paper with a help number to call which I couldn’t call because I do not have international calls on my phone plan and refused to let me use a phone. When I asked for a supervisor or manager she brought me 4 different guys that were not a supervisor or manager and lied saying they were. I had to pay another cab back to my hotel and also pay for another night there. Finally back in America, I’ve been calling everyday Delta customer service to speak to a representative and on hold 5 hours for the past 4 days which every time I get to 5 hours it just magically disconnects. Finally I got through to someone, she was the sweetest person who works at Delta, and shortly after being connected we were disconnected. I tried calling one more time today, and after 5 hours and 45 mins I was connected with someone, I explained to her the situation and this lady now that I was speaking to was even worse than the workers at Panama Airport. Overall Delta needs to reevaluate their staff, this is so completely unacceptable. I was not refunded nor credited, nor even tried to make accommodation for the cab and extra hotel night I had to pay. This is such disgusting behavior, and I will not be returning to Delta ever again. I hope anyone considering Delta completely goes straight to Jetblue where they value and care about their customers and always make the moment right."

Instead of sympathising or providing me alternatives they gave me a $2000 option to reschedule my flights by a week, this is after already having paid $4000 for the initial flights. I would have rather spoken to the Robot option as I am sure the robot would have been more empathetic. Instead I was able to use e-credits to book myself a week later in Basic Economy. I paid almost twice the money to get 1/2 the service, well done Delta! I wish there was an option of negative infinity to rate their customer service."

I was on the phone for two hours and no one answered so I went onto the website. I was talking to an agent through chat he had rebooked me then he charged me 300.00 for the flight difference. Once I get to back to the airport for my new flight they tell me my payment was not on the system. I tried to show the staff my receipt and the messages that I was going through the airlines website. After they told me to call them. At this point I was done calling no one answered I had tried to reach them all morning. I had been at the airport in Atlanta (which is 2 hours away from my home) all day. I walked away and the staff member yelled “walking away won’t fix your problem” I was very frustrated with everything going on. I needed to be in LA but the next day once. The staff yelled you forgot your ID and once he saw I was in tears he called someone to see what was going on with my ticket. I felt humiliated by a staff that did not want to help. They charged me an additional 300 to get one the plane. I honestly will never fly with a them

We traveled from New York to Sydney this week and overall a good enough experience but I won’t be flying again on long hauls with Delta. In my opinion, they weren’t very flexible with understanding when customers fell asleep and their mask fell down a bit. It happened to us, and many others I witnessed. They would wake you up from asleep and tell you to fix your mask. A little more situational awareness wouldn’t have gone astray."

This time it had some pretty expensive impacts. We arrived at the airport and found out 20 mins before boarding the flight was cancelled. We had an Air BNB (non-refundable) set up a Turo rental (non-refundable) and tee time for golf booked (non-refundable). We are out quite a bit of money that we would like to get reimbursed for or compensated in kind. I understand that there are times ""act of god"" where weather is an issue or things out of Delta's control happen. This is not the case as we were told that they didn't have a pilot. This just sounds like bad planning and we shouldn't be victim's of that kind of issue. The average wait time to talk to anyone is 3+ hours which really is ridiculous."

607,2,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Austin,April 2022,1,5,,,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Let me just start by saying, riding with Delta this past Sunday was a major inconvenience. On April 3rd I arrived at the airport around 4am to catch my 6.45am flight that would later connect to another flight in ATL. My first flight of that day went smoothly, and I took note as to how the different groups of passengers were being called as to not overcrowd the area. As I had previously flown into CHI using a connecting flight, I had plans to be back in Austin by 12pm so that I could make it to work later that day. When I arrived in ATL, I walked over to station B28 as to be ready to board the plane. I arrived early and I paid close attention as the passengers were called to board the plane, however the screen never changed from saying “PRORITY”. As the announcer called passengers, she announced 1st class, main cabin 1, main cabin 2 and main cabin 3 but to my confusion she never announced BASIC. As time neared for my flight to leave, my roommate and I walked over to the station to ask when they would announce for “BASIC” to board the plane. I watched as a woman and her daughter were helped to board the plane and I stepped up to be boarded right after her. The lady spoke with me and said “I’ll be right back” before closing the door to the plane in front of me and a group containing at least 5 other passengers. The conversation that commenced after her return was very sad when referring to customer service. Not only was she rude to me as a passenger but she seemingly taunted the fact that my flight left without me on board. As she faced me, there was a lady in a red suit to her left who also claimed she wanted to help but offered a 4.40pm flight as a substitute for my 10am flight, omitting the fact that there was a 12.30am flight that she had access to add us to as standby passengers. Both ladies are a poor excuse for employees at a company that is supposed to pride themselves in customer service. Taking the conversation from 0 to 100, I believe it took more effort to be rude then it did to just help us and apologize for the inconvenience. They argued the fact, saying that I was not at the door when I clearly contacted her before she turned her back on me. Not only were the two ladies rude but they seemingly meant harm in their demeanor, and they wanted my flight to leave me behind. As a customer, I am feeling very deterred to ride with Delta again because if I paid for a flight, I should be able to ride on my flight without complications and poor attitudes from staff. I feel these two ladies were upset with the fact that passengers were slow to accept checking their luggage and they decided to take out their frustrations on the passengers. After getting help at the main Delta help desk, I felt like the employee wanted to be helpful, but the conversation could only be what I feel was “he said she said.” As the lady could do nothing to help me further with submitting a complaint about my previous interaction with the staff at B28 at 10am. The rude behavior from your Delta employees persisted and even as I was placed on standby flight for 12:31am I was still not properly confirmed on my flight. I went to the desk of station B5 and when I asked if he could explain what “standby” meant he rudely told me “Look at the screen” as he continued his conversation with a coworker. Maybe all the employees that work with Delta in ATL specifically are just used to being rude, but that's not fair to customers"

My flight from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta yesterday was delayed 50 minutes due to to purported ""baggage loading"" issues. Actually, the problem was caused by not having enough Delta baggage employees to service the number of flights out of this airport. Initially, the pilot said it would be a delay of 5 minutes, which became 15 minutes, which became 30 minutes, which became 50 minutes. This caused me to miss the connection in Atlanta. NO DELTA staff attempted to assist passengers with extremely tight connections in deplaning. Nobody from Delta met the plane. I was informed I would be rebooked on another flight in TWO DAYS. Delta employees were rude, unhelpful, and dismissive. Obviously, treating passengers this way is a daily occurrence for them."

What upset me our gate was abandoned by the staff and no explanation was given while the board only displayed a flight delay. After asking other delta gates I was told ""we can't help you with that"". I then waited another 3 hours just to get my luggage back. After all of this they were not able to offer me another flight for an additional 5 days leaving me stranded on my trip. I had to spend over $1000 in additional hotel, parking, and living expense on top of loss of wages from my job. I reached out to customer support and they offered me a 50% refund on my $180 round trip flight. They told me the best way to get home would be to purchase a $200 one way ticket.

623,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Charlotte ,March 2022,1,1,1,5,1,5,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  My wallet fell out of my purse on a Delta flight from Atlanta to Charlotte. I went to back to the airport and checked with lost and found etc but it had not been turned in. Thankfully a flight attendant called me and told me she found my wallet on the plane but she was now in Detroit with it. She was trying to figure out a way to get it on a returning flight to Charlotte that day, with another flight attendant or she was going to bring it herself in two days on a returning flight. It seemed it would all work out and then the Gate manager got involved and confiscated it from the flight attendant. The gate manager promised the flight attendant that they would call me ASAP but no one called. (Still no call three days later). I called the Detroit Delta Lost and Found, the next morning, and spoke to an agent and explained that the wallet was located and positively handed off to the Manager of all the Delta gates at A27 on March 27th. The gate manager is aware of who I am and my wallet. The woman on the phone said to me that they had not retrieved any of the found items from the gates and it wasnt really a priority! I exclaimed that I was stranded in Charlotte until I could get my wallet back. I begged her to take my phone number and She rudely told me to fill out an online report. That was it! I did as she asked and waited all day. Its now three days later and I am still waiting. I had to cancel my flight. I'm missing work and I have no money or ID. I cant believe how unhelpful Delta has been. I will never fly again with this airline. I should mention that the first blow was that on my 5.5 hour red eye flight from SFO to Atlanta we were not offered anything to drink. Not even water. when I asked the flight attendant, he was very rude and returned with a half full plastic cup of water. I was extremely dehydrated the entire flight. Delta is terrible. The only highlight of this story is the nice flight attendant who went out of her way to help me, until her employer destroyed all progress."

I had a round trip from Delta airlines and the Delta employees messed up with my boarding pass at the gate, eventually leading me being noted down as a ""no-show"" for the first part of the flight - and of course I ""was"" on that flight. Then they cancelled my return ticket. It turns out that not only I am considered as a no-show for a journey that I made, they don't even let the customer know once they cancel a ticket. So they cancelled my return ticket and I only discovered about it a few hours before my return flight. On top of my distress (I was trying to figure out a way to go back home, there were no other available flights until the next day) the person at the desk was super rude saying ""it was my fault"": I showed up at their gate with the correct boarding pass and they messed things up afterwards, with multiple employees involved in the process and I am the person to be blamed here? Spent ridiculously long hours on their customer help lines just to reach a single person to talk to (6 hours for a single call) and ended up with literal ""nothing"" other than a wasted ticket, money spent on an overly-priced flight to get back home, hours and hours of distress and unkind behavior from their part, all on top of their own mistake."

626,1,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Pittsburgh via Detroit,March 2022,1,1,,,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Our flight departed at 5.39am, so we showed up 2 hours prior to departure. The ticket desk wasn't open, so we were stuck in the lobby with dozens of other passengers for over an hour. This caused a massive crowd and lots of confusion going thru airport security. As if that wasn't bad enough, for whatever reason despite my husband and I being ticketed on the same confirmation, we weren't assigned seats next to each other. When he made the reservations, he made sure to request a window seat for me but somehow Delta assigned us to middle seats on the opposite side of the aisle. He spent over 2 hours on hold on Saturday trying to get our seats reassigned so we would be next to each other, only for the customer service agent to tell him that we would need to speak to the agent at the desk to get reassigned. My husband tried to ask, but couldn't even finish asking his question because the agent cut him off and rudely announced over the intercom that there would be no seat reassignments. He asked the flight crew as we boarded, only to be met with blank stares and headshakes. They were unwilling to move other passengers to keep us together. We were now at the mercy of our fellow passengers, none of which were willing to switch seats to keep us together. I’m sure you’re wondering why this is important. I’ve flown frequently, and have noticed that sitting in the middle causes me to have anxiety, motion sickness, and feelings of claustrophobia. And this was all exaggerated by having to wear a mask for a prolonged period of time. My only chance for comfort on this flight, was having my husband by my side, and being switched to a window or aisle seat. I almost immediately had the worst panic attack of my life. Full out crying and shaking. The flight crew walked up and down the aisles past me, not caring that they played a part in my suffering by not moving other passengers to keep me with my husband. And my husband was unable to comfort me, being stuck across the aisle and between two strangers, so this flight was rough on him too. Finally, when one of the flight attendants did ask me what was wrong (while pushing the drink cart up the aisle) I told him, thru my tears, that I needed my husband. He asked me where my husband was, and I told him, but he did nothing to correct my situation. My panic attack lasted the duration of the flight.  I couldn’t get off the plane fast enough. I was so shaken that I didn’t want to get on our connecting flight.  All in all, your team had several opportunities to correct the situation, and dropped the ball repeatedly. Completely disappointed. I’ve always had a high opinion of Delta until now. I’ll probably never fly Delta again, based solely on this experience."

We get to the airport and our flight gets canceled and we are rebooked for the next day. Not being from Cancun we obviously have to buy a taxi, a hotel, and food for the night. We also don’t get to make money (me and my partner) tomorrow because we are now flying. I didn’t receive a flight voucher and when I called about getting one the customer service woman was honestly a witch. She was extremely condescending, told me it’s not Deltas fault and that I would have to eat the costs, well it’s not my fault the flight was delayed either. She started verbally yelling at me and it’s pretty appalling since I fly so much with Delta and just want my stay covered. I’m very upset and honesty wish I got her name because it has been the worst end to a vacation. Will never be flying with Delta internationally again"

When I tried checking in an hour later, my connecting flight had been delayed two hours — meaning I would be stranded in Detroit (and I wasn’t going to sleep overnight in an airport). The customer service agent in Hartford was apologetic, waived the bag fee for my luggage and helped rebook me for Monday (meaning I would be stranded in CT for one more day). The following morning was better and both flights were uneventful and on time. The trip insurance covered my extra hotel stay and two weeks later, Delta customer service refunded over half of my ticket and sent me a $200 flight voucher.

I have complained before, but Delta has been unresponsive to a horrible problem. During the height of the pandemic, customers were put on hold for up to 20 hours (20 hours!). Now it is down to anywhere from two to five hours. Delta requires human contact for many minor details (such as bringing a dog). But contacting a human at Delta is virtually impossible. And they are generally rude and unhelpful after I spend hours trying to make contact. I have been cut off several times after being connected. The virtual assistants are terrible, too. How can a computer be so stupid? It has been programmed into it. The virtual assistants keep repeating the same information and questions and do not understand what is input by voice or typed. I once loved flying Delta. But the effort has gotten so onerous I have switched to other airlines whenever possible. Those other airlines answer their phones without hours of holds.

634,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Houston,March 2022,1,1,,,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," I am very unhappy. My plane was set to leave at 7.20pm then only 5 hours prior to the flight the plane was delayed and moved to 10.10pm and then they changed it to 8.40pm takeoff and then after boarding 30 minutes later then the boarding time of 8.0pm we are sitting on the plane for over two and a half hours on the runway. They say we’re about to take off and then we are just waiting around for two hours on the plane completely claustrophobic, not COVID friendly whatsoever and all they tell us is that they have to wait to switch directions. After they said they were able to get an alternative route they say the plane doesn’t have enough fuel to do the alternative route and say we have to go back to the gate. Then we are told that the plane isn’t allowed to take off and that we are 'fortunate' to have a gate to come back to because some planes have to just sit and wait on the runway when their is no available gates. My question is, if you originally had the flight at 7.20 departure and then delayed it to 10.10 why would you then undelay it and then only move it to 8.40? Because we’ve been on the plane for more than the second delay time of 10.10. I am extremely disappointed. This was my first experience on Delta Air Lines and this will be my last! I have flown on 100+ legs, over 10 different countries and I have never experienced an issue like this before. At least on my other airplane experience they kept us informed. Delta is not transparent and clearly is aware of the situation so why move the delay down just to have everyone sit on the plane for 4 hours past the original departure time? This is the time that I should be arriving at my destination. And the only thing they tell us is “sorry” and then offer our headphones to people and say “these are normally $2 but we’re giving them away because of the delay”. Two dollar headphones treating it like they are doing us a huge favor, they should at the very least give us food. I am blown away and shocked by the unprofessionalism of the company. Then they kick everyone off the plane after sitting in it for hours and tell us the staff needs to go home because they’ve been overworked and can’t go over their hours and that we need to just wait to see what will happen and when they will get new staff and they kept reiterating that the flight was not going to be cancelled only delayed, and then boom after waiting from 5.45pm to 12.45am (7 hours) I find out that our 1.42am (delayed 5 times) is now cancelled. They told me the next flight at 6am is fully booked and then next flight will arrive around at 6pm on Friday. I am missing an entire day in my destination zone and my original flight I had picked specifically based off the time to make sure I would not be missing any work and now I am missing an entire day worth of work and who’s going to reimburse me for that? And also let my job know? I think after waiting 7 hours for a flight where the staff decided to disappear and sitting inside an airport breathing in the air of other people who could potentially have COVID during this pandemic. Completely unacceptable whatsoever. Delta can state that the plane was cancelled due to weather but I don’t agree with that, they are using that as an excuse so that they are no liable for my flight and all the people who had to sit around for 7 hours waiting with full hope for a flight that got cancelled when the crew left. I deserve to be compensated."

January 2022 they pulled 12-14 people (who just went they TSA and had nothing bad in their luggage) aside, to go thru their stuff, taking so long that the pilot went over their flight-hours, forcing 200+ people to deboard and stay another night to catch the next plane at 5 pm. Never reimbursed us after they promised to. Today, March 23 2022, we made the mistake of flying Delta again. They didn’t checked if the plane worked until boarding 200+ passengers, only then did they realize the snow censors weren’t working. Instead of immediately boarding us on a plane that works, they had their maintenance man “try to fix it” for 3 hours, then deboarded 200+ passengers and causing us and many others to miss the connecting flight. Not a single Delta employee prioritized their customers. They told us they’d call the gate to have them hold the plane since it was Delta’s fault, got to the gate and they said they never called, so they took off without us. "

Then the return flight next day NYC to ATL, we started getting emails about the flight being delayed again until we received a cancelation of the flight notification, and a confirmation to put us on a plane 2 hours later to Madison Wisconsin, 2.30 mins flight and then 1 hour after back to Atlanta. Original itinerary stated our landing time in Atlanta was 9pm, we ended up arriving in Atlanta at 2am. And the cherry of the cake: they lost our bags, wasted an hour and a half waiting on the belts for the bags, never showed up, they were still in Madison, then another hour making a line trying to talk to Delta personnel. We got home at 4.30am that day. Our bags were shipped to our house and arrived at 3am Monday morning. I normally speak high of Delta but not after this, they didn't even try to fix anything, didn't seem worried, nor concerned about the delays or any type of compensation.

Two different phone numbers we found had wait times of 4.5 hours and 3 hours and the messaging system had a wait time of 3 plus hours and the system kicked us off before we could have a chat. The baggage claims woman in DFW could not have been much ruder. I arrived at 11:00 p.m. They said they could not deliver after 10:00 p.m. but they would deliver the next morning. They gave us no call or text or email and no number to call them in DFW. I have been a multi-million miler for almost 30 years. I don't fly much now but there is no customer service in Delta any more. Absolutely no one to actually talk to. Even with this matter, they simply said it is a 3rd party delivery company and basically washed their hands of us. Update. The bags just arrived. They were delivered by someone who is actually in the pool service business. He had no idea of the history of the bags he was just an occasional driver when his other business is slow. I gave him a $20 tip because none of this was his fault. I place the blame strictly on Delta."

Flying out of Orlando, Delta canceled our flight to New York, and they gave us no reason why, which led to us having to drive 4 hours to the next available airport to get a layover flight to Georgia then New York. Then when flying out of New York after our vacation, Delta canceled almost all of their flights due to staffing issues. Delta is on their way down, so do not depend on them for flights where time is of the essence. Once on the plane, the screens and staff are nice accommodation but you have to be on the plane first to enjoy this."

My wife and I flew from St Martin to LA , via NY. Delta web allowed us to make a booking that made catching the connecting flight impossible in NY. At the help desk at list 70 people were waiting, most of them international travelers. We asked the person at the desk if we could be looked after before the international travelers so we could catch the next flight to LA, leaving in 2 and half hour time. We were flatly refused and sent to the end of the queue. Surely we missed the next flight, after standing in a queue for more than 2 hours. The next available flight was next morning at 10.30 am. By right we should have been provided with accommodation, but no, we had to spend the night at the airport (my wife and I are 70 years old). They gave us a 60$ food voucher for two. Next morning we were able to leave earlier at 7 am, thanks to a much nicer person. Arriving in LA, we learned that they lost our baggage. We got them back 2 days later, just a few hours before our flight was leaving to Australia. Out of the four baggage three of them were damaged , I mean destroyed. Making a claim seams to be impossible on Delta's web. If you do not like stress, avoid this airline."

Leaving our home at 1am to make it to the airport in St Louis early for the flight, my mom was greeted with a 1.5 hr wait at the bag check and ticket desk. She didn't even make it to security. Once they finally addressed the 50+ people waiting in line, it was to tell them all that after their hour and a half wait the plane(s) had left without them. They stranded 50+ people at the airport. And when they told my mom the lady at the counter scoffed at her as if it had been her fault! I spent 7 hrs on the road this morning having to go back to pick her up after their failure. After contacting the chat online I was transferred to two different agents who told me three different stories. Ultimately I was told I have to call in not use chat (after 2 hrs of chatting) and call in to receive a 4 hr wait time on hold! Still on hold. So here's one for you Delta Air Lines, today because of your horrific customer service: My mother was disrespected in public by your rude employee. I lost $75 worth of gas I lost $625 of potential income for the time I spent having to travel to and from unnecessarily due to your failure I put just short of 500 miles on my car. My mother will not get to go see her first grandchild until we receive your ""possible"" refund in at the earliest 7 business days, too bad this week was the only time available in our family's schedule. So here's to you Delta. We will never fly with you again and will be sharing our story far and wide. You can bet on it! Update: 4 hrs on hold and they closed for the night without answering my call. Update: after holding another hour and a half this morning to Delta. We found out the lady at the airport didn't refund the ticket! Also they will not make this right and said compensation is not due to us."

I'm flying on the Delta One suite on their new A350-900. Well, the value for money wasn't great with the new pandemic regulations, so that is acceptable. To start it off, the cabin crew was great, just like the old times. Friendly and caring, showing that they really like their job and they are enjoying what they are doing. Off to a great start. A flight attendant specifically, has shown care and compassion throughout the flight to us. Off to a great start, Delta. Now, talking about comfort. The Delta One suite offered a comfortable space. I'm not tall, so I didn't experience any discomfort. It was heading straight, except for some curves which some other premium cabins consider for their business/first suites. Heading over to entertainment. It was truly a great variety, featuring all genres of movies and even new releases! But the music had its limitations, even by having a collaboration with Spotify. But it was good nonetheless. Wi-Fi wasn't connecting to my laptop, but it connected to my phone without a problem. Now talking about the food. It was absolutely delicious with its really premium feel to it, with 3 options. We were served lunch and breakfast. Between both meals, we could have snacks at any time if we felt hungry. Well, to conclude, this really was a great experience that absolutely blew my mind. Will for sure be flying with Delta again. See you next time Delta Air Lines!"

Everyone was extremely rude before we got to the plane and they did nothing to accommodate our trip. Flight attendants were very sweet but that was about it.

If we flew Southwest, we would have made it from Reno to San Diego in an hour and twenty minutes. However, thanks to Delta we've spent the last 8 hours traveling due to delayed flights, rude staff, and a the most chaotic, inefficient boarding system I've ever witnessed. In Los Angeles, they had five flights departing from the same gate. So after our first flight being delayed two hours, we figured we would miss our connection. However, due to the horror show at our connecting gate, we ended up two hours delayed again. The worst part was seeing the gal at the gate being rude and snippy to an elderly gentleman who was confused (like the rest of us) why five different flights were at the same gate and they were all behind. I will never book with Delta again. We could have drove faster. Don't waste your money or sanity with these folks."

Just to find out that at the gate they would not talk to us till 1 1/2 hours prior to flight. Then finally they talk to us and we tell them she says they are over booked I said that’s fine if we could at least get one of us with my youngest we will be ok. She said I will call my supervisor see what we can do to seat all together or at least 2 of you. Tells me to sit and she would let me know. So I sit and I see other family of 5 show up and talk to her after me. And she never comes back and says anything to me but the other family got to sit together. I would of been fine even if she would have at least came back to tell me hey I’m sorry we could not get you to sit with your youngest but the fact that she just said nothing really upset me.

Went to get my boarding pass back to Tampa, it cost me an additional $78.72 and I experienced the most unprofessional and rude customer service I've ever had. When I tried to explain what happened, they made me feel like I had something wrong. After over 8 hours on hold this morning with Delta, I finally got a representative on the line and she said this is a WestJet issue, when I spoke with WestJet yesterday, they said this is a Delta issue because I booked through Delta.

To make matter worse, the gate agents get loud to embarrass you on the flight for asking what happened, and basically are rude and smug. They do nothing but almost mock you for being upset realizing you can do nothing about it. Fortunately other airlines are beginning to increase routes so even from Atlanta you don’t have to be stuck in Delta. Terrible experience."

After about a 40 minute process I was rebooked on a different flight - leaving 10 hours later and getting in at 10pm (my original flight was supposed to get in at noon). The phone agent suggested I go to an 11:15 flight to SEA to see if I could do standby and then onto PDX from there. Once I arrived at the gate they started the process, but after a few minutes said it was too difficult, there were only middle seats available and if I wanted to go forward with the standby it would cost $75. Wanting to save time I gave them my credit card and asked to be on standby. A few more minutes went by and the gate agent informed me that it was going to take too long and she could not do it. When providing a customer, a previously very loyal customer, a seat on an aircraft it a contract between the customer and the airline. This contract was broken - not only did Delta give me seat away that I paid for in good faith. They also wasted hours of my time, which is more of an issue. We are avid travelers and fly at least 20-30 times per year for both personal and business travel. Therefore, we feel we know how to navigate air travel."

Flew from Seattle to New Orleans with layovers on both flights (4 separate flights in total) and had an awful experience on all of them. Attendants blatantly ignoring the service light (happened on two flights), seats changed to the absolute back next to the bathrooms. Split up from my fiance twice - wifi not working on two flights Thoughts: Delta used to be one of the best. They are trash now, unattractive service is the only way to describe it. They just don't care, flying is supposed to be an awesome experience to see family or new places, and they just don't care."

Both seats were open and available when I upgraded my husband's seat, Then for whatever excuse you want to give, I was unable to upgrade and sit beside him.  I have been very loyal to Delta in my travels. I have not complained about the 4 hour delays and flight cancelations of late, and I feel Delta does not seem to care about loyalty. So disappointing. This is the only time my husband has flown with me and I've been shown nothing but disrespect this entire trip."

My flight was scheduled 4 months in advance, then I get notice of a change in the flight and I try to cancel my flight, apparently Delta can change things and the customers can not. I tried to get a refund still three and a half months out from my departure date and Delta refuses unless cancelled within 24 hours. The flight that I was on was 90% full and it could very easily be filled in the next three and a half months but even so they are going to keep my money. "

Plane has a horrible smell. Crumbs and filth all over the floor and arm rests. Flight attendants are terribly rude. While boarding, someone else stuck their incredibly large luggage above my seat (this passenger was seated nowhere near me.) The flight attendant made me leave the plane to check my bag in. There were valuables in the bag (the bag and it’s contents were worth over $2,500.) I asked if the persons luggage could instead be removed from my space due to this and I was again told to just “check my bag.” I will never fly Delta again."
677,2,,Family Leisure,First Class,Orange County to Fort Lauderdale,February 2022,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,0,Not Verified ,"  I have flown Delta for the past 25 years. I have been on 3 flights with Delta in the last 4 months. Each one of these flights were terrible service. I have been surprised and shocked by the amount of bullying, lack of service or attention to passengers by 1st/business class crew members.  My last flight which was an overnight flight from LAX to Fort Lauderdale, which I booked business class. When I booked, I specifically asked if the flight had beds in the 1st/business class and I was told it did. Otherwise, I would never have spent the money I did to fly 1st/business overnight. Not only was there no bed - the seats didn't recline anymore then in the main cabin. I realize this sounds obnoxious to be complaining about 1st/business class seating. The issue is how much we pay for the seat and what it suppose to represent. Not only was there no bed or even an upgraded recliner seat, there were no blankets, no pillows, no service and a little snack in a cardboard box! It's pathetic and all under the disguise of Covid, yet all restaurants are open and serving people. Worst of all - the outbound flight was freezing. The cabin temperature was less then 65 degrees the whole trip. It was miserable! When I asked over and over for the cabin to be a bit warmer I was told how the cabin temp. was not controlled for my comfort, but rather the whole flight. I get it, but everyone was complaining. I won't even get started on the how aggressive the flight attendant was about masks up during sips of our drink. It's all shameful! I work very hard for my living, and in my business. I would never be allowed to treat my clients with so little regard. I wouldn't be allowed to bully or speak rudely to my clients either. I can't speak for everyone and by no means are all crew members bad - there are some great people out there working and doing their best each day. The issue and why I am taking my time to write this is the new lack of service, concern or care for passengers. I sincerely hope our country and these companies one day find their way beck to customer service and detailing services. Back to respect for all passengers whether 1st/Business or Main Cabin and stop looking at their profits or if they're properly diversified. Just hire the best person for the job, hold those people accountable and take care of ALL paying customers. "

I have tried to contact customer service three times today and waited on hold for almost six hours to file a claim about a lost phone on a Delta flight. Considering the fact that there is a time limit to submit such a claim, it’s ludicrous that Delta makes it so difficult to do so. The first time I called, the person told me to call a different department and just hung up on me, the department I was told to call was the wrong one and he couldn’t help, the third one just transferred me to the airport lost and found without even taking the 5 seconds to hear that I lost it on the plane. To have paid for three round trip tickets through Delta this week and to get such terrible service is a slap in the face and delta should be ashamed to employ such incompetent people."

It was an emotional trip and not an easy one to take but the Delta flight attendants made it so nice. On our return trip, the stroller that we gate checked was damaged. I contacted Delta and they worked with me to get the matter resolved and they reimbursed me. They have a process that they need to follow but I had a death in the family and was unable to comply. Rather than excluding me from reimbursement because I couldn’t comply, they worked with me. Delta is a huge corporation and I am one in a million customers but they treated me like I was their only one. I recommend going with Delta!"

681,1,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Minneapolis to Los Angeles,February 2022,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Minneapolis to Los Angeles. I typically fly first class for several reasons, the first and foremost reason being that there is extra room. I was flying from MSP to LAX. My husband and I have flown this several years ago and it was absolutely miserable. The seats were so tight that we couldn't even stand up. My husband is 5'10"" and about 165 pounds. He is very physically fit. His knees were against the back of the seat in front of us. The seats were so narrow and tightly squeezed that he started to have a panic attack and got sick. Because of this previous experience on Delta, I decided to get first class, however, the ticket was about $2,500 which was out of the question for this trip. I got their ""comfort plus"" seats. I'm 5'7"" and about a women's size 12- so not huge. Their comfort plus seats are a complete rip-off. They are the exact seats as coach with about 2 inches more of knee room. That's it. I asked the desk attendant about why their comfort seats aren't larger or more spacious and she said ""you're not paying for more room, you're paying for amenities."" Really? So I paid $400 more for a bag of chips and a $1.00 set of ear phones? Yes. Theoretically, the comfort plus is supposed to get on first to get that precious bag space above the seats, but even that backfired, as they allow anyone to go on during their ""comfort plus"" seating and although I sat in row 10, my bag had to be put over seat 16 which made retrieving it after the flight a nightmare. It's clear that Delta does anything possible to give you the very least of everything for the most money they can nickel and dime you for and I will no longer fly with them. I was a loyal frequent flyer with Northwest before it became Delta. Then I was a loyal Delta flyer until they decided to pack people in like sardines and do everything possible to screw us out of more and more money. I will only fly with them if they are the last resort and would even take the ""budget"" airlines over Delta now."

They woke me up to put my mask over my nose. I went back to sleep and it happened again. After being harassed by not one but 3 flight attendants, they had a red coat pull me aside once we landed and barade me some more. They even threatened to kick me off of the next flight if I didn't sit there and take it. I'm comfortable with the fact that I will never fly with them again. I knew I should have flown on Southwest.

There were crumbs and bits of food all over the tray table and seat. What's worse is I wrote a complaint to Delta and never received a reply. I sent another message to them two months later and still no reply. As a Platinum frequent flier I am very disappointed in Delta.

688,1,,Couple Leisure,First Class,Seattle to Hartford CT via Atlanta,December 2021,3,4,2,2,4,2,3,0,Not Verified , My husband and I were flying home to Massachusetts to spend Thanksgiving with my brother. We purchased our refundable ticket online and checked refundable. Refundable was quite a bit more than nonrefundable. When our tickets printed it didn’t have refundable on it it had the fine print about a nonrefundable ticket. Called Delta and they confirmed it was refundable so I did not purchase insurance. We were originally supposed to go via Minneapolis to Hartford but Delta changed Minneapolis to Atlanta to Hartford. Call them to see if we could just go Seattle to Atlanta to Hartford since we would’ve been connecting with the Atlantic flight anyway. They said yes and told us we would be getting a refund of $233 per ticket. Well they ended up giving us a credit because they said we had a nonrefundable ticket. Galls me that they take your money and then don’t want to give out back. I do not want the credit I want a refund. Contested it with charge company which credited my account but then Delta said no we had a nonrefundable ticket so our charge company charged it back. Next time I buy it airline ticket on any airline I will make a screenshot of every step to the purchase so I can prove that I bought a refundable ticket just based on the price.

Delta offered no lodging even though the only flight offered wasn’t for almost 15 hours later. The airport won’t let you stay in a secure area. I have no idea where I am and no Delta personnel seem to care. It’s cold and I’m sitting on the floor in the front the airport with no type of security till the airport reopens. This is how Delta treats their sky priority first class ticket holders!

692,1,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Rome to New York,February 2022,3,1,2,4,2,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,  This is by far the worst experience with Delta. The head flight attendant and another flight attendant were the rudest people I’ve ever encountered. I was in premium and my husband was in delta comfort. When we boarded I asked my husband to sit next to me since I have anxiety with take off. The plane was half empty. She approached us almost scolding at my husband for not being in his seat and snatched the headphone away. It wasn’t about the seat being premium since the amenities were subpar to begin with. I’m not upset because of him going back to the seat but they were horrific and rude about it. They were both hostile towards me in a condescending tone.  As we were about to land my husband moved up so that he could retrieve the luggage from the overhead bin but the head flight attendant stormed over and said he could not sit there. I asked for her name and she raised her voice saying that she did nothing wrong.  As I was getting off the plane she told me to wait for a customer service person to speak to me. After a 10 hour flight the last thing I want is to wait even longer at the airport. She then responded with ‘whatever’. I’m horrified with her unprofessional behavior. I’d never fly with Delta again if that’s the representation of their service. The bathroom was disgustingly dirty as well. Considering they are the most expensive flight going to Europe there’s no value in it at all.

694,5,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to New Orleans via Atlanta ,February 2022,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,0,Not Verified ,"  I was aware that Delta was Virgins US partner, and quite expected to fly Delta internally, the flight from Atlanta to New Orleans and return. What I did not expect was the flight booked with Virgin internationally would be with Delta also. The whole point of booking with Virgin was to travel with Virgin. I will be asking questions of them also. I was not told there would be a change until it came time to check in, and by then I could not change without losing money. Delta check in was OK. The crew seemed impatient at passengers taking their time to sit down and get comfortable. One female crew member was quite rude and sarcastic. Food was atrocious, and on an 8 to 9 hour flight we had one meal, and a snack. I talked to another passenger and she agreed, they didn't feed us very much. The flight itself was fine, and the crew member I had was lovely. My point being: Crew was not welcoming or even enthusiastic. Your passengers might have saved for the two years of Covid, looking forward to their holiday, encountering this experience, and dreading their return flight. The change from Virgin to Delta - I know this may not be your fault. The overall Delta experience was just not pleasant, and it should at least be that. I fly enough to know the good from the bad from the reasonable, and this experience was somewhere between the last two. Virgin on the way back, a whole other story - beautiful uniforms, young, helpful crew, nothing was too much trouble, even went an extra mile or two when I said I was slightly claustrophobic, and went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable. I really want to fly with Virgin again, but if I know that journey will also include Delta? I might seriously think twice."

The attendants focused too much on the masks on and not enough on our comfort. On the return flight we were extremely thirsty, as they only provided drink beverages once vs twice as they did on our first flight. Which just amplified the fact that everyone was very hot. Horrible air circulation. Also, we checked our bags in using the Kiosk, only to find out we still had to make the long counter lines to check in bags. Because they were short staffed.

The Delta agents were amazing! The gate agent calmed me down, and booked us on the next flight, the ticketing agents found us seats and walked with us to expedite security so that we would make the boarding after obtaining our luggage from Frontier. The Delta staff in Punta Cana made a nightmare travel situation better. I had purposely avoided Delta when the became “political” but this experience will make me reconsider."

This means she allowed all previous passengers to board with more than a carry on. We have 3 small carry on we used to flight light from EWR to MCO to spend the weekend. If this is the service Delta provides then is very poor and unacceptable. We are trying to go back to reality and back to traveling. If Delta doesn’t know how to instruct the employee so that the rules are valid for some passengers only then it is useless to be a member, to have delta Amex cards and to try to support what I thought was a good airline."
698,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Minnesota to New Orleans,April 2021,,,,,,,1,0,Not Verified , I purchased airline tickets with Delta last April and had to cancel them due to Covid-19. When I was issued the credit I was told that I would have access to the whole credit for future travel no matter who was flying. When I tried to use my credit today I was told that I was only allowed to use a portion of the credit because of the way the agent issued the credit. I was also told that if the other passengers would lose the credit. I paid for the tickets with my credit card and was told that I was able to use the whole credit. I’m not a happy customer and don’t plan on using Delta Airlines again. It’s not fair that I was told one thing at the time of the cancelation and then told something else when I tried to use the credit today. I’m losing a lot of money and very upset about it.
699,9,Boeing 787-10,Family Leisure,Business Class,Newark to Los Angeles,January 2022,5,5,4,4,4,,5,1,✅ Trip Verified ," First, I don't quite understand the overwhelming number of horrible ratings on United in particular and US carriers in general. I am not sure if I was lucky or I am not demanding, but my experience with the airline was quite fine so far (knock on wood). It is certainly not top notch but not horrible either. I, for sure, have encountered unpleasant experiences, but that happened to me even with the best rated airline. I think US carriers' weak spot is ground operations, with so many short, small flights that are plagued with delays, cancellations and gate changes (Asian full-service carriers use wide-body aircrafts even on one-hour flights). Now, here is my opinion about this particular flight. Ground service at EWR for Premier class was seamless but not exemplary, and that was certainly below the level of Delta One. In-flight hard product was where this flight shined. The 787-10 was shiny and clean. The Polaris seats were comfortable, spacious, and last but not least, provided a great deal of privacy. This was one of, if not the best equipment for a 5-6 hour flight I ever experienced, even when compare with intra-Asia business class from top rated airlines. On board staff were pleasant and accommodating. Food choices were limited, but I can see improvement on the taste. Food service and presentation was not quite at, though were inching back to, pre-pandemic level. The flight departed on-time and arrived early, but we were still late as we had to wait for our arriving gate, a LAX signature. The IFE screen was nice and responsive, though movie selections were not as good as what on Delta. Overall, I have no complaints."

When I called they said the hold time would be 5 hours. As I said, I have a small infant and needed to make sure this was done so I had no choice but to wait the time. Unlike other businesses that are all understaffed they do not give you the option to keep your place in line and receive a call back like everyone else. The fact that they feel somehow like people that are spending hundreds of dollars with them have the ability to do nothing else that sit and listen to hold music. The kicker to this is after 3 hours and 47 minutes yes, it just hung up on me. I will never, ever in my life fly this airline again. You can push people only so far Delta."

My complaint is with their app and their customer service. I needed to catch an earlier flight out of Pittsburgh due to weather and I wanted to get home earlier. The weather actually forced me to wait until it was within 24 hours of the flight. The app has an option for changing your flight within 24 hours built into the UI. It allowed me to go all the way through putting in my CC number and billing info and repeatedly would not work. Now mind you, this is the second time this has happened to me using Deltas app. On both occasions, I had to reach out to customer service for help, and as most of you know who have ever had the displeasure of having a need for their help, you can expect to wait a long time. So after waiting 2 hours for them to reach out to me via their text messaging service, the seats that were available 2 hours prior were gone and the flight I needed was fully booked. How they can honestly say thanks for being the best part of Delta after providing terrible service is beyond me. Most likely will not use Delta again. I need better flexibility in my travel than they can apparently provide."

If you buy a basic economy, the lowest fare, you have to pay a penalty of about $90 if you change or cancel the flight. No exception even if you get Covid. No mileage added for this kind of ticket.

Then, I had an issue .and a scene was displayed. We had been left in Dallas on the runway by AA due to de-icing problems, not allowed to retrieve our luggage, rented a room there, returned to DFW in the morning and flown to MSP at noon and then nothing. A plane full of people who paid top dollar to fly to Fargo and couldn't. Delta promised to get us home, but not without drama. My husband was able to get out on the 3:30 flight but my grandson and I had to fly standby for the 7:40 flight which we didn't make so we had to wait for the 11:50 pm flight. I went up to the desk for clarification on a confirmed seat and presented the gate agent the paper ticket and she said ""I don't know what that is!"" so I dropped it on the desk for her to punch in the computer to which she replied ""this isn't a trash can honey"" I was shocked and so was my Grandson. Disrespectful, rude. When we went back to get her name, a Burgundy jacket Delta rep asked why I wanted her name and then told me no. Then said it wasn't his area and went to the next desk.

I did not sleep at all, since yesterday morning! How unprofessional can you be. I travel every weekend and have no desire to spend my free time at the airport. Do you pay me for the day I lost Delta? No Delta for me until they figure out how to run their business!"

All those who got on the bus after you did get off first and take up all the overhead bin space. So glad I paid for a first class ticket. This is wrong on every level of customer service. Shame on you Delta. I have to gate check because your staff is to shy to ask those you stuffed there bags in first class overhead to remove and gate check those bags.

No customs agents on hand, Crew timed out, still stuck on plane 5 hours and counting with no end in sight. No food offered, no drinks offered for last 2 hours. Complete chaos of a situation.

Changing my flights constantly so I now have a 5 hour layover. Longer than the flight times put together. Truly garbage customer service. On top off boarding passes not have the gate on them. This is the worst experience on a trip ever. I thought I’d give them a try but it was a huge mistake."

When I wanted to make a complaint, they say there’s 3 1/2 hours or more of hold time, and with multiple attempts, I always get disconnected after about an hour or so on the phone. I tried to do it through text and online, but still no one wants to help me. They refer me back to the phone number, which doesn’t let me connect to a live rep. There were multiple issues with my connecting flights, costing me an extra $2000 to get home. There’s a huge laundry list of other issues but I don’t have all day to write them down. Suffice it to say I will try using a different airline than Delta, they were horrible."

Grace Marie with Delta Airlines took care of everything for me. She was a breath of fresh air after the hours I had spent on the phone with my rental car agency and Priceline. "

Paid for First Class and that was a mistake, I will never do that again with this airline. Rather than make a laundry list of all the issues we encountered, suffice to say that it became a high stress trip and it should not have been. Avoid paying for upgraded seats on Delta domestic flights, it comes with nothing, it’s a bus ride, nothing more. I will try to avoid this airline when possible on future trips."

Arrived to SLC to find out that my flight to Honolulu was delayed by 7 hours 40 minutes. Went to help desk to ask about other options and was told that there were no options. Since I have time I look myself, I go back and ask about the multiple options I found and they finally agreed to look. They then tell me I can go through Seattle so I reluctantly agree. When I asked about my seat upgrade I paid for they just laughed and told me to ask about it at the gate. They booked both flights with a middle seat when there were plenty of options. I am currently sitting in the plane to Honolulu waiting for them to figure out which flight attendant staff will be joining us because they want ours to go to South Korea instead. Fully loaded plane ready to go! Told us it would be 30 minutes and has been almost an hour. This airline is the absolute worst for customer service and logistics. Not once was I treated with respect or sincerity. I will never fly Delta again. And to think these airlines are the first to cry for bailout money when things get tough only to layoff their staff and jack prices up all while quietly buying back stock options. "

Our new departure time changed from 12:45pm to 1:45pm to 2:20pm and then 4:15pm. Absolutely unacceptable. Delta will do almost anything to not refund you your money. I’ve only ever flown with them twice and both experiences were dreadful. I don’t even know how they have a 4/10 review rating because it needs to be at 0. I’m completely done with Delta they’re just not worth all the hassle and obstacles. We were flying domestic and they don’t seem able to handle such trips."

Flight was delayed 20 min due to ""short staff"" as told by the pilot on intercom system. Arrived in New York 30 minutes late then had to wait another 15 minutes to be taxied to tarmac. The pilot then came on the intercom and stated ""nothing we can do we are short staffed just waiting on taxi to tarmac"". We missed our plane connecting to BWI. We were told to go to help desk. When we got to help desk they offered a plane ticket for 6.5 hours later with a 15.00 food voucher for 2 people to eat at the airport. We asked for a supervisor, the lady told us to stand aside. We were then told that the supervisor was busy on the phone right now and there was nothing else they could do. We complained then the supervisor came out and told us that it was not Deltas fault. I said your pilot told us you were short staffed, I said so are you. She said I can’t give out that information. It was unbelievable how we were treated and Delta did not take responsibility at all for us sitting at the airport for an extra 6.5 hours due to their own fault. Never again will I use this airline. This is not how I want to end my vacation. Due to the high cost of tickets the way this whole situation was handled unprofessionally. First and last time this family will use Delta."

They do not care you are missing connection flight and can has no bag finally in the hotel. They do not listen you problem. Delta is really bad and sad experience but charging much like a good service. Broken day! Crew on board has last 2 rows empty but did not allowed to seat there in case to feel more space, even in that bad situation. Use Delta only like last call"

I thought I had completed it (at no charge) but when I got to the airport they could not find my new flight or my original departure flight. After some searching it was determined that in my haste to change the flight I inadvertently changed the time only but on the original date. Because I had already changed it once I was going to have to pay for the second change. She took the time to speak to a manager and figure it out. Non-stop to my destination without an extra charge. Totally a positive outcome!

The flight was overbooked so Delta asked for volunteers to give up their seats. My wife and I said what the heck, let’s do it. Another night in Honolulu! Well, Delta gave us each $1500, a free night at the Marriott resort downtown, and free round trip transportation to and from the hotel. The young Delta employee at the gate was most helpful (in spite of the late hour). In the process we hired an Uber driver who was a charm. He was Korean and spoke little English, but enough to get us to the Marriott. Once we arrived, he helped us with our bags, and told us he would be there to pick us up the next morning. We told him that we had to be at the airport at 6 am and he said no problem. The next morning, sure enough, he was there waiting for us, with donuts as a treat! We tipped him nicely. BTW my wife bought an Oculis with the money, and booked us on another flight to Honolulu (our son, daughter-in-law and young grandson live in Honolulu). Thanks, Delta, for a really great time and for meeting some great people!"

Being 5 foot tall, the extra legroom was not a factor for me in my purchase. What was a factor was the comfort items said to come with this premium seating; a pillow, blanket, etc. I was very disappointed to be told on both of my delta flights that neither a pillow nor a blanket could be provided to me. I was actually very uncomfortable the entire flight as it was very cold and there were no pillows and blankets that I could get, even though that is the entire point of comfort plus seating."

Arriving at the airport in Hartford at 3am on Sunday, December 5, we found that we had not printed out the final authorization from the government authorizing our entry into the country, though it was on our phones. The Station Manager was ever so patient and kind and smart, because it was not easy to download them, and print them on Delta's printer, which we sent using her email. After quite a bit of trying, she met us at the gate to continue attempts until she finally succeeded in printing the forms out for us. She literally saved our vacation. The rest of the Delta staff, on all 4 legs of our trip, coming and going to St. Lucia were also patient, courteous and professional. The flights were clean and on time and reasonably comfortable. They had Peloton meditation and chair yoga videos as part of their on line entertainment, which I enjoyed. In this very stressful time for air travel, it is nice to have only good things to say about these flights, and this airline. We plan to switch our frequent flyer mile credit card to them. The snacks and beverage were standard airline basic but the people serving them were great."

After the conversation I received an email the it was an e-credit so I called again and was told by a 2nd rep that it will be changed to a full refund and I will have it back to my credit card within 7 days. When I did not receive the credit I contacted Delta on Jan 3rd and was recited their policy that it is an non refundable flight and there will be no refund. When I explained I was told by 2 reps that I would I was told you were given wrong information and you will not get a refund. I also explained we couldn't fly due to Covid and if we did we would have infected far to many people again I was told sorry that's our policy and the rep literally hung up on me. I waited a few days and called yet again to be told again sorry that's our policy. I would think and hope that a company like Delta would care a little more for their passengers especially in the trying times we are in. Delta just really doesn't care and are not compassionate to what this pandemic is doing to people. Its so sad they are willing to hold their policy against a family instead of understanding."

They said sure, but you will have to pay a 99$ fee for every reschedule. Totaling 300$, and on top of that, I won't even get refunded the 350$. Instead It'll be taken as an e-credit. The customer service was so dry and uncaring about it. I was on hold for 2 hours for a text message associate, that then told me to get connected to customer care, which was another 2 hour wait, then when i got connected I explained my situation and they said I can't help you, but I can add you to the customer care queue. They were the reservation queue. I told them, I didn't really want to stay on hold for another few hours. As I've already been on hold for 4 hours.... they said, Ok, let me check the queue, and abruptly connected me to the customer care queue. Where I ended up waiting another 2 hours.

No warning nothing, (this is my first time ever flying) then we were handed an 800 number to call for Delta which was even a bigger joke.

After that time the person came to me to tell me that no matter ticket was sold by Delta, the flight would be operated by Aeromexico and they cannot do much in regards of cancelling the flight I told the lady I had to wait more than two hours on line to get such answer?

Delta clearly states this is a benefit of this option when selling it while booking a ticket. Still they charged me $75 to make a change to a later flight on the same day. It’s over 3hrs to wait on the phone for customer service. At the airport every Delta personnel I tried to get help from with this started their response with, ""I’m sorry but unfortunately"".. No one budged to help me in the least. I’m a fairly even-toned individual and have a dry sense of humor so I pointed the Delta typical trainee I’m sorry but unfortunately bs, out to the woman at the gate to have her get extremely loud and embarrassing and I actually get threatened a bit. As I tried to go to a seat, this woman kept approaching me and being loud until I finally had to get somewhat loud myself and ask her to leave me alone.

On the way back, Delta's staff in Panama don't know the regulation and don't know English, they didn't know that we don't need a visa to enter USA, made us wait for an hour and half to verify our Canadian passports.

730,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Atlanta,January 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ,"  My son just turned 2, and they insisted he wear a mask on the plane. I know that might not sound like a tedious request to some, but for many people with children 2 and under know how hard it is to travel with small children. And then to add having to make sure your 2 year old keeps his mask on for 2 hours, is another task. The staff were not polite about it either. They actually said they would kick me, and my 2 small children, off the plane, if I couldn’t keep my 2 year old babies mask on. However, if they would have politely said: ""ma’am we know your son is a baby, and you are dealing with making sure you have all of your luggage, your children are safe beside you, and getting to your seat. But when you are sitting down could you try and keep your sons mask on"". I would have appreciated that much more. We are frequent flyers, and have never been asked to make sure my baby under 2 feet tall, is wearing a mask by any other airlines. This staff obviously do not have children. Amongst the chaos of traveling alone, to be sympathetic to a single mother, with 2 small children the staff member at the front gate, was incredibly rude when telling me to put a mask on my baby. There were several passengers behind me that actually expressed how rude she was, and sympathized with me on how hard it is to travel with small children. The Flight Manager, announced to half of the plane he was going to kick us off the flight, if it was impossible to keep my 2 year old’s son from pulling his mask off. For Delta managers: This is flight number: DL2596 Writing this review for single parents with small children during Covid. I would not advise flying Delta. I will never choose this airline again."

I checked in at EWR and left my small suitcase to be checked. The agent asked for $75. I told him that I am entitled to one free checked piece of luggage because 1) I have a DELTA SKYMILES AMERICAN EXPRESS GOLD CARD I paid for the ticket with and 2) I am a SILVER MEDALLION/SKY MILES ELITE member. He asked to see my Amex card and I showed it to him and he returned it and said all was fine and gave me my boarding passes and claim check. It wasn't until I was onboard my flight from Atlanta to Paris (AF) that I discovered that he'd taken the Amex card and swiped it, charged me $75 anyway, and had hidden the charge receipt behind all of my boarding passes. That is so dishonest and deceptive. I wrote to Delta to complain and two months ago I received an e-mail that just said they were going to notify the concerned departments of this issue. To me, this is theft of services and I don't know if I should forget about it or call the police. The staff at the gate was very professional and handled my business documents correctly."

I was going from Anchorage to Salt Lake City, with a layover in Seattle. The first flight had serious turbulence and movement, which wasn't Delta's fault. What was their fault was the fact that they had no barf bags anywhere in my row. As you can imagine, this caused a problem. The second problem arose with the layover timing, which was a ridiculously small time frame to get from the first flight to the second flight, which was accentuated by the fact that the first flight was around 20 minutes late though it claimed to be ""on time."" And then, after all of that, they lost our luggage. They claimed it would be here this morning in a ""worst-case scenario,"" but we're still waiting. It's still in Seattle, with no info on when it will be here. This was a nightmare travel experience. "

In my trip from New Orleans to Boston on January 1st, 2022, I had 4 flights cancelled. My original flight from MSY to ATL to BOS was cancelled, and then I was rebooked from MSY to LGA to BOS, which was also cancelled. I was then put on standby from MSY to JFK to BOS, managed to get on that flight to JFK, and was supposed to have a 6 hour layover - I was able to switch to flight DL675 to BOS so I wouldn't be getting home at 11 PM, and was told by the Delta employee who rebooked me that my flight would be protected--that was then cancelled, and I was told I could not even get on the standby list for the 8:59 PM flight to BOS that I had switched from. I talked to a Delta employee and asked him to cancel the 7:00 AM flight (5762) I was automatically rebooked onto for the next day and request my luggage so I could leave the airport and take an Amtrak home. I waited for 5 hours on the baggage claim floor for my bag (with at least 10 other people doing the same), and was told by the 4th Delta employee I spoke to, 4 hours into waiting, that the 3 Delta employees I had already spoken to who said my flight was cancelled and my bag was requested had actually done nothing. The one competent, nice Delta employee finally requested my bag for me — I then waited another 45 minutes, and then that same employee gave me a file number and took my home address to have my bag delivered to me so I could leave the airport, since it was already 11 PM. By the time I left the airport to go to a hotel so I could catch an Amtrak in the morning, it was too late to cancel my flight, despite the fact that I was told by multiple Delta employees that they cancelled it for me. I had to purchase a hotel room, an Amtrak ticket, and leave without my bag and just hope it actually gets delivered to me. I will absolutely never fly Delta again."

740,2,CR 900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Houston,December 2021,3,2,,,1,1,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  This was such a horrific experience I’ll never fly Delta again. Three days in a row they cancelled the exact same flights, and had one of the flights delayed by the exact same 4 hours each evening and yet claimed each occurrence of having no crew was random. Gate agents were either clueless or rude, many were unable to perform reticketing that I was able to do through my app. Somewhere around the evening of day two of waiting, they gave everyone meal vouchers, which might have been nice had a single restaurant been open once they decided to give them to us. One agent told me that if you leave security, you can’t come back through (clearly untrue). One agent told me they could not put me on a partnering airlines flight…I confirmed with someone else that they are required to do so if they cannot serve you (they could not, it was going to be more than 24 hours). So I went back up to counter, asked again more finely and they agreed. But, she “had trouble with the system” miraculously until exactly the minute after I could no longer make that flight. They made people wait for 7 hours in the airport for flights where no crew had been scheduled and none would be coming available, three days in a row. On our last delay, we were told “they hoped our crew, arriving from another city, wouldn’t time out before being able to fly.” I’m sorry, you don’t know whether the crew were waiting for is going to be eligible to fly? Seems like someone should have that information, right? I don’t blame the airline for a cancelled flight, or even 8 cancelled flights. I blame them for a combination of stupidity and actual deception that cost many people a lot, and for a complete callous disregard for the feelings of customers. I watched every other airline handle limited crew with no issues and with some kindness and empathy. Delta employees clearly didn’t care at all, and I’m done with them."

We came back every day to see if there was any flights and the attendants were very extremely helpful.

Mara deserves a raise! Thank you Delta for such amazing service! And please thanks Mara for me!"
742,1,A220-100,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Denver,December 2021,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ," The flight to Denver was a nightmare having us stuck on the tarmac in Seattle for 2.5 hours due to an engine malfunction on the runway. The the return flight was cancelled with Delta providing no assistance or other options to get home and  their website was down not allowing people to get their refunds for the tickets. The only option was to call Delta's phone number which currently has a 4.5 hour wait time with no call-back option available. Long story short, this trip is the prime reason I stick to Alaska Airlines whenever possible and a reminder that it isn't always worth saving an extra $50."

After going through security and coming up to the gate and talking to the rep owner I was informed that there were seats available but I had to use a courtesy phone. Hold time is 5 hours. This is the most ridiculous customer service I’ve ever experienced. Who in their right mind since it’s OK to have a customer on hold for five hours.

Flight from Detroit left when we were on the ground ready to make connecting flight. They knew we were on the ground. Left anyway leaving us with several hour wait. Staff unhelpful helping us to get off the plane first knowing we had 26 minutes to get on the connecting flight. Unable to get off plane in Minneapolis because another plane used our unloading platform knowing full well we were on time, even early. Only one info desk to assist with making new flight arrangements. Staff slow. At least 30 people in line ahead of us. Waited over an hour. Cleaning crews late making boarding late. Have been at airports and on planes since 11 this morning. It is now midnight with no end in sight. Hired transport company left us after making 2 trips to airport and waiting for over an hour. "

I dont want to forget to mention the seats and windows on the plane were sticky and had what looked like cola drops on the windows. I will not be flying Delta again."
746,2,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh/Durham to San Antonio Airport,December 2021,4,4,3,4,1,,2,1,✅ Trip Verified ,"  While at the gate and returning from San Antonio, Texas on December 26, 2021, customer service asked for any courteous traveler to check their carry on luggage in order to make sure everyone had room. Being a retired USAF service member, I thought I would be able to serve again by checking my carry on luggage, therefore freeing up an additional space for other passengers. I sat down by the window facing the aircraft and noticed the man that I had taken my checked in carry on luggage open a door to the outside of the walkway to the aircraft. I then saw him bring my bag out first and throw it down this 40 to 45 degree angled ramp. It went about 30 to 45 feet and bounced off of the railing at the bottom. Then he proceeded to throw approximately 13 to 15 more bags down on top of mine. As they slid down they literally bounced off of my small carry on luggage until the pressure was too much and they just simply stop bouncing and continued to press against my small luggage. When I arrived home, after my flight to Raleigh, NC and begin to unzip my bag, I immediately noticed that it had been significantly damage. This was a brand new SwissTech luggage I had just purchased for this trip. The way all of our bags were treated after we attempted to be supportive of the mission of your program is totally unacceptable and whomever is in charge of this part of your program should be ashamed. I will never provide you with the opportunity to treat my personal stuff in the manner in which you treated it this time. I am extremely upset and after paying over $1400 for tickets for me and my wife, it is extremely disheartening to find this is the best service you can provide. My rating below will reflect my disappointment with this part of your program/process in particular. It is not a reflection of other aspect of the services provided during the trip. I will recommend Delta Airlines to family and friends, however I will warn them not to go out of their way in any manner to accommodate a request from your company."

Horribly rude staff and then gave us tacos for dinner which I had to pay half the bill because they said the drinks and only a certain dollar amount was allowed after we already eat. They say that we need to be at the airport at 7 am but they don't know if our plane will be able to fly so no departure time just wait till they can figure it out. I know it's the holiday but come on we have been patient we just want a little respect and for Delta to do the right thing. I ask everyone to stay away from Delta as they don't care what happens to you after they get your money.
751,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Eugene to Salt Lake City,December 2021,2,2,,,1,,1,0,Not Verified ," Terribly disorganized and unhelpful. I get that it's the holidays so everything is a bit crazy, but everything I dealt with could most definitely be handled better. The day before I left, I tried to check in for my connecting flight and it wouldn't let me. I had to sit on hold for about an hour (while at work mind you) trying to figure out what was wrong. I was very concerned as I knew no one in the state I'd be connecting flights with, and I'd have no way to get home for a while without getting on a new flight. The lady I spoke with said everything would be fine, I'd get my seat assigned at the gate. So the next day, I take my first flight, and go to connect to my second. I get to the gate and ask the lady behind the desk for my seat. She told me ""you're going to have to wait, we oversold this flight and I have to make sure you still have a seat"". I was very upset by this, as I had already explained that if I got stuck at that airport I would be there for a while. Eventually, she confirmed that I had a spot. I finish that flight, and go to the carousel to get my suitcase. I checked my app and it said my bag had been scanned and sent to that specific carousel ... but it wasn't there. I stood there waiting for about 45 minutes trying to find my bag. It never came up, so I went to the baggage office, where they initially tried to brush me off and said ""you just didn't wait long enough, you need to go back and look more"". This made me extremely irritated, as it was obvious they just wanted to get me out of their way, and they didn't really care that my bag was missing. Even when I explained that I had important medications in there, their attitudes did not change. Eventually, a very nice agent named Arthur helped me get a ""lost or mishandled claim"" filed, and he was probably the only helpful Delta associate I dealt with this trip. I am currently on hold with the airline, still trying to figure out my bag. I've been transferred twice and have had no communication on their end in over an hour and a half. I didnt really like Delta in the first place, but now I definitely will never be using their services ever again. It is so not worth the hassle, next time I'm just going to drive."

I decided to volunteer my carry on bag since it was a little bigger, and they needed the room. So no laptop or personal items i would have normally had with me. I get to Detroit at 5:30am, next flight to Pittsburgh was delayed due to no crew. Then the flight updated around 9:40 to canceled. Next flight out wasn't until 1:45, no one can tell me where my bags are. I had to ask 2 different help desk. Other plans an reservation had to be canceled. And now stuck at the airport no phone charger, no laptop. Now have to spend more money on food that originally was not accounted for. I flew delta because American had something similar happen in Dallas. This experience was horrible, next time I'll drive."

They were distributing cups of water during this covid pandemic period stating that they don't have bottles of water. Of course they brought bottles of water after people complained about the water in cups not being sanitary or practical for the kids on board. I am irritated that i spent $2662 to be treated like this by Delta airline and something really needs to be done. If it was other regular flights they would have put more effort in it but since we are just a group of maybe 200-300 west Africans (Senegalese) we got treated very disrespectfully.  Its now 1230 am and we are sitting in the airplane still looking for a miracle.

760,9,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Honolulu to South bend,November 2021,5,5,4,4,5,,5,1,Not Verified ," I thought Delta did a fantastic job during the course of our 13hr journey. The Flight Attendants were all extremely courteous and welcoming. We had two layovers and it was as comfortable as it could be sitting on a plane for 6 hour increments. We did hit a snag from Georgia to South Bend. Our layover was already 3h30m and the plane was delayed and hour but the gate agent decided not to inform any of us. So everyone sitting at the gate was just staring at each other wondering if there was a change. Luckily for us it was the last leg of the trip so we had time to spare. If others were connecting to other departures, it definitely would have been an issue. We did sit in Comfort plus which I believe was worth it for the long journey. They don't over meals but they do come around often with snacks and various beverages. They also had a pretty great app that's extremely user friendly and tracks your luggage if you decide to check in. I would consider strictly flying with Delta but may have to find another Carrier going to SBN. It seems their only route is through Georgia, and not only is the gate completely on the other side of the airport ( a good 40min walk) I was completely turned off by the lack of communication from their Gate Employee."
761,8,Boeing 767-300ER,Solo Leisure,First Class,Bogota to New York,June 2021,4,5,3,3,5,3,5,1,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Delta never fails to impress but there were some glitches this time some not due to the airline and some did. Check in in Bogota was fast, too many questions were asked before being able to check in by security. Once provided with a boarding pass there was no line for Delta One customers so it took more than hour and a half standing. Lounges were closed due to covid but also by the time I had made it past security it was already almost time to board the plane. What made this flight memorable was the attention provided by the lead flight attendant which went out of her way to make me feel welcome. Unlike my previous flight also on Delta one as soon as upon entering she walked me to my seat and asked me is she could stow my jacket. A duvet, pillow, Tumi amenity kit, noise canceling phones and big water bottle were waiting on my seat. While taxing dinner orders were taken as well as drink choices and throughout the short 5 hour hop back to New York City many rounds of wine were provided. The meal was a veggie sandwich with hummus, some custard which was amazing, salad and wine. Later on I found out the same was offered on coach so this is where the airline lagged but to their defense meat wasn’t allowed on flights by Colombian authorities due to the pandemic. Inflight entertainment was okay small selection on these older aircraft and my seat was comfy enough to sleep on. Bags arrived on time after landing."

(I had not actually cancelled my flight to Paris). After spending quite a long time (39 minutes) on hold I was connected with an agent. Shortly after connecting with the agent, my cell reception tanked. The agent stayed on the line with me for whole minutes - knowing that if we disconnected, I would be returned to the start of the queue. I am so grateful for this agent who persevered, waiting for me to move into better cell reception and complete my last minute cancellation. Thank you Delta. I like to fly with you already but this small nicety made a huge difference for me today. Thank you to the Delta agent for your grace, composure and patience."

It's always been my favorite, but the rude mask policy changed that for me. I have asthma and was struggling for breath, plus my mask kept sliding up into my eyes. I had it over my nose (completely covered) but apparently that wasn't high enough for the staff at the entry of the plane, who then tattled with text messages to the steward in the rear of the plane. I was literally being policed and all while I was struggling for breath. "
764,1,,Business,Economy Class,Boston to Dallas,April 2021,1,1,,,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," I had to enter my last flight however this is about an upcoming flight BOS to MCO that needed to be cancelled. Delta advertises it is so easy to travel without worries, no change fees, can cancel and have eCredits. Well guess what? I bought a ticket for myself and an employee last July to travel next week and she no longer works for me, trip is cancelled. I have a credit for my ticket, hers has just vanished. Can't get satisfaction with chat, call in, wait time is 1 hour plus. I think its quite a racket to assure customers that there are guarantees then oops if you buy multiple tickets you only get a credit for the one in your name, over $800. Maybe someone could help me over the phone but who has an hour plus to wait to see if that is the person who is going to help. I've tried several times. I wonder how much money Delta pockets doing this to people. So dishonest. If I bought the ticket for an employee, who does not have a Delta account, who typically does not fly and then there is no credit that's like thievery. I have always flown Jet Blue but have started moving to Delta because JB doesn't have a first class but at least I've never had an experience like this."
765,1,,Business,Economy Class,Syracuse to New Orleans,December 2021,1,1,,,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,  I fly twice a month and Delta has been by far the worst airlines. They cancel connecting flights when your several states away from both home and destination. They do this for no other purpose but not having enough customers to make it worth their time fiscally. They will make you sleep on the airport floor just because. I am not flying to go on vacation but for family purposes and I do so in between my work which I am able to do remotely but it is to the point I will leave a negative review (which I have never done in my life). If it’s the holidays or you have anything important to tend to don’t risk it. Delta will be the first to pick the dollar over its customers. When I was in the air about to land they cancelled my connecting (again) and an hour later while talking to customer service my partner was still able to purchase a flight for this time slot which at a later time they told him it was delayed (by 656 minutes). It’s unethical business practices at the very least.

When I went to get back on the plane they told me my ticket wasn’t valid anymore and then I had a new ticket booked for tomorrow even though my seat was still empty and I could’ve caught that flight. Went to customer service and they just gave me the run around. Then told me I could call on the black phones downstairs knowing that customer service is closed at this hour of the night."

We were assured multiple times that parties would be kept together, and asked not to check with gate attendant. Got separated from my family anyway, and while I get that it's tough to change anything with the plane already halfway full, it was frustrating to be separated at the end of a long day because of a mistake made by a company I paid for a service, and to get a very sorry-sucks-to-be-you attitude from the crew."

Now that I want to redeem my money they are saying they can’t find any record of it and there’s nothing they can do. So I am out somewhere around $800. Customer service tried to find it, and then said I should have kept track of my flight number and info but I was never told that when I called in, I was just told I could redeem for another flight on a later date. If I had known this was a possibility for all of that money to get lost I would have just gotten a monetary refund. This makes me very distrustful of Delta. Delta lost my business."

She placed my son and I on the very last seat of the plane instead of trying to correct their mistake! I always fly with Delta and I must say this was one of the rudest agents I have encountered!

I have been using Delta for years and this is easily my worst experience with any flight. Terrible customer service. Our entire return flight was cancelled and rescheduled for 24 hours earlier, cutting our vacation short by a day. We received no notification of this change and I only learned of it by confirming details because our trip was approaching. There was no flight available out of Alicante leaving and arriving on the days we originally booked. Delta offered no other options for helping us. I found a flight serviced by Delta out of Barcelona with days and times that were similar to our original booking. Even though we would lose money on train tickets and lodging, I suggested this. I was told I would have to pay the difference in fair and they would not offer an voucher, miles, or upgrade to compensate. The flights they offered out of Alicante were all overnight layovers in Amsterdam. I was told they would not provide a hotel voucher or any compensation for this solution either. This was an awful experience. Delta is going downhill."

Since we were booked out of ATL and I wasn’t sure if she could return in time for our trip, I called trying to determine what alternatives we had. Changing her flight from San Francisco was unaffordable so I mentioned to the woman on the phone that that wouldn’t work for us and I also remarked that I might end up cancelling it. She went ahead and cancelled it without my knowledge nor any indication that she was doing so while on the phone. I never received an email verifying that a change of any sort had been made. I found out two days before our scheduled flight, after we had gotten her back to Atlanta just to make this trip. We found out by trying to view our flight details. I called Delta immediately and they said I would have to pay a difference in airfare even though I never requested the change. The agent made it clear that I would not receive a refund despite the fact that there was a “misunderstanding.” He also claimed that Delta does not record the conversations and therefore could not verify that this cancellation was not requested."

778,4,,Business,Economy Class,Billings to Boise,November 2021,5,5,,,1,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Delta used to be the best airline. While I was in the military I used to fly delta specifically because you could get to your destination faster if the flight ahead of you had seats or there was a more direct flight that had seats. Today as in right now I am on a flight to San Francisco to turn around and go to Boise. I board at gate B1 in SLC, at gate B5 there is a direct flight to Boise with 3 available seats in comfort. So not only would I have one less flight I would have given Delta more money for a seat they had open. I did this exact thing all the time for 9 years when they were green boarding tickets, this proves it is possible yet here I am doing something stupid that costs more money for delta. "

I flew EWR DL x/ATL AF x/CDG AF MAD on November the 6th. I went to the check-in counter at Terminal B and the agent there asked me for $75 for my small carry-on. I told him I didn't pay that because I am Air France ""silver"" & I paid for the ticket with my Delta Air Skymiles Gold American Express card which allows me and my traveling companions one free checked suitcase. I took out the Gold card and showed it to him, and he punched a few things into his keyboard, and told me it was fine and handed me back my card. It wasn't until I was on my Air France flight from Atlanta to Paris that I saw that he'd hidden behind all of my boarding passes a charge slip for $75. If he was so stubbornly intent on charging me $75 despite my two mitigating credentials I would have carried my small suitcase aboard the flight - in fact at the gate at Newark the Delta representative (very professional in the way he handled my travel documents) offered to check all carry-on suitcases to the final destination free-of-charge. I don't understand why I was ripped off and so deceptively! (It was like something out of the Trump administration), and there they are ripping off their presumed best customers (I am now ""Gold Elite"" with Air France/KLM/Skyteam including Delta). I wrote to Delta customer relations nine days ago but not a word from them. I do not know if I should abandon my Gold American Express card in protest and go back to flying on the One World Carriers (Platinum/Sapphire status) - they occasionally rip me off too but not so brazenly. I am just disgusted by the whole issue. Otherwise, the flight on Delta was fine and went as expected (as the French say, it was ""correct.""). But what a sour taste in my mouth!"

When we reached the ticket counter they informed us that our tickets were canceled and there is no Delta office in Istanbul airport we can contact. Luckily we had money to buy return tickets the next day. We have been calling Delta for two days and didn’t reach a mutual agreement, when you call prepare to stay on the line for a minimum of 60 minutes and if you are calling from overseas imagine the cost, the last representative was so rude. Pay a few dollars more and get peace of mind. The choice is yours."

783,1,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Tel Aviv to New York ,November 2021,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Flew roundtrip ""Delta One"" from NYC to Tel Aviv Israel and back. Food was disgusting and rudely served. For tickets that are sold for between $9,000 to $12,000 roundtrip it was ridiculous. We wanted to complain to the Purser but she and most of the cabin crew were sleeping at the back of the almost empty economy class. The consensus among the passengers was never never fly Delta One. It is economy with flat beds and not worth the money. The inflight entertainment was broken for most of the trip and the cabin crew admitted they knew it was broken and was broken on the previous flight."
784,8,Boeing 767-300ER,Family Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to New York JFK,August 2021,4,4,4,4,3,,4,1,✅ Trip Verified ,"  First, the check-in process at LAX was excellent, with private check-in area for Delta One. The whole process was seamless. In contrast, the arrival ground service at JFK was horrible. Somehow Delta decided to disembark us at the deserted T2 instead of the normal T4. We waited nearly 30 minutes at a small baggage carousel, only to know later that our luggage came out from another one across the terminal. After rushing to the right carousel, as it was too small, we could not even come close to it. I saw our luggage but could not break through the crowd hogging the carousel to get them, and imagine it happened during the pandemic time that required some sort of social distancing. I booked the flight with anticipation to fly on the new Delta One ""Suite"" on board of the 767-400ER. However, Delta changed it to a 767-300ER with older, less spacious seats. Well, I don't complain as we still got flatbeds with direct aisle access. Food presentation was at pandemic standard, meaning worse than before. At least the food tasted fine and we were well fed. No complain here either."
785,2,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Louisville to Raleigh Durham via Atlanta,November 2021,3,4,,,1,,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  My wife is flying home and we switched her to a Same Day earlier flight. I tried calling, and Delta's hotline told me a 30 minute wait, or I could text with an agent. I texted with an agent. I asked him 3 times to confirm that my wife was on the earlier flight, asking him to double check the Confirmed status, the new arrival time, and again that her status was confirmed and NOT standby. He confirmed (in writing/texting) THREE separate times that she was Confirmed, not on Standby. Low and Behold, my wife gets to the airport and she is not confirmed - she is on Standby. I tried calling to talk with someone and their hotline gave me an error saying there were technical difficulties and then hangs up. So I text the number back and start everything over trying to talk to someone. The new agent responds to my text once every 5-10 minutes or so. She starts off by telling me there has been no change to my itinerary (as my wife has ALREADY caught the 1st earlier flight). Then when I point this out, she tells me (15 min later) that I should have reached out before my first flight and she can't change anything now. When I point out that I did reach out before my first flight, she (after another 5-10 minutes) then says that I'm 62nd on the standby list. When looking at Delta.com, I'm listed as 2nd. I point this out. Then (after another 10 minutes), she says that I an pay $75 to switch from standby to confirmed. I say do it. 10 minutes later, the door closes and they tell me the flight is full. I tell her so and she apologizes nd explain that she had to deal with other customers' inquiries. She then goes on to tell me that I really should have known better and that since I never paid the $75 fee, I shouldn't have expected to be on Confirmed. Despite what the first agent told me That's why I called in the first place - to figure out what I needed to do to be Confirmed! One of my worst experiences by far - your first agent literally lied to me so that he wouldn't have to help me, and your second agent took 10-15 minutes to respond to any text messages, after which (in less than 10 minute responses) then implied it was my fault for not knowing better. What an awful experience!"

After waiting on the phone half an hour for customer service now they tell me they could be here between 11-6pm. He says a six hour window, last time I checked that's 7 hrs.

787,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Atlanta,November 2021,1,1,,,1,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Delta overbooked the plane my family and I were taking from Orlando to Atlanta. So 5 of us were told we have been moved to a later flight. Our original flight was scheduled for take off at 3:30pm. And our new flight was scheduled for 4:15pm,. So we walked over to the other gate as instructed just to find out that our flight was delayed until 6:00pm. We had already been at the airport all morning so I was little irritated by then. However when it was time to board at 6:00pm, the plane sat there for 40 mins with no take off. I could hear the flight attendants say they have been working for more than 15 hours that day, so everyone was taken off the plane and by then we had missed out connecting flight home from Atlanta to Omaha. We had to wait until 12:30 AM for Staff from another plane to take everyone at that time from Orlando to Atlanta. I couldn't believe how long I was forced to sit at the airport just for a 1 hour flight. They didn't offer food or drinks to any of the passengers who missed dinner and were staving. Needless to say, we didn't arrive to Atlanta until 2:30 Am. But then we still had to catch a flight to Omaha. Delta made us walk from the airport to a hotel at 2:30 AM to Sleep for 3 hours and then we had to walk back to the airport so catch a flight at 8:00Am to Omaha. Not only that, but we got lost trying to find the hotel and its very scary to be walking around in that area that late. I will never fly with Delta again. "

I had an unfortunate and stressful travel experience and Delta staff was helpful the whole time. When I was leaving Calgary to head to Green Bay, my flight was cancelled last minute due to a system outage with Delta (700 flights cancelled in one day). I was put on another flight for the following day at the same time but needed to get to Green Bay the next day. I got on the phone as well as messaged their help text line and within an hour and a half an associate was able to get me on a new flight for the same day through a different airline for free. For my flight home, my Covid test to get back into Canada was 19 minutes too early so the Canadian boarder wouldn’t let me on the plane. So the Delta associate at GRB (Christine) was able to book me on a new flight for 3 days later free of charge and ensured that if I got my new Covid test back earlier that I could get on the earliest flight out (also free of charge and if they had seats available). So I did end up getting my Covid test back a day earlier than my scheduled flight and went to the airport and Christine had me on the next flight out! It was such excellent service and the staff were so helpful and did everything they could to ensure I got to and from my destinations as soon as possible."

Today I flew Delta from Orlando to Atlanta then to Greenville Spartanburg and I have to say I was highly displeased with deltas handling of luggage. I flew with my family and there were a handful of us that received our luggage in terrible condition. So when I picked up my luggage at baggage claim I was shocked to say the least. There were so many scuffs on my suitcase that i now have a lovely zebra print suitcase. If I wanted my suitcase threw around like a sac of potatoes I would’ve flown spirit. There were also pieces of my suitcase that went missing. I have a designer label suitcase so i would very much like to know why my suitcase was unzipped at the top. There was nothing missing so i must not of had what they were looking for. Then my aunt received her soft top suitcase and it was ripped down the front. And to top of just a perfect flying experience my little cousin that had her souvenirs from her first trip to disney in her suitcase never received her suitcase because they lost it. So I think I speak for everyone when I say “Wanna fly American next time?”"

793,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Spokane, WA to Seattle, WA",October 2021,3,3,,,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," I am writing this review for my friend who was the actual traveler on this flight because I booked the flight for him after he asked me for help to get him to a close friend's funeral in Spokane. My friend is 78 years old and has no wish to use the internet, nor is he familiar with it. After the funeral another friend his age drove him to the airport with the deceased friend's cat in tow. When these two elderly gentlemen arrived at the airport there was nobody to man the desk at Delta. A member of the security staff directed them to another terminal where he had seen some attendants, but after a long trek with kitty in tow they returned to the Delta desk, having found nobody to help. A Delta employee then showed up and asked them if she could help. The plane was already boarded, and she held it so my friend could get his boarding pass, pay for the transport of the cat, and go home. She then rousted some employees from what must have been a break room and handed my friend off to two of them. These two employees were apparently unable to work the Delta computer system, and after a number of attempts the flight left, stranding my friend and cat in Spokane for the night with all the costs that entails. When my friend voiced just how upset he was, without threatening anybody, he was threatened with removal by security. He did eventually get his flight changed to the next day, and was able to make his way home. What a terrible way to treat an elderly gentleman who has just had a very painful loss! I felt simply awful to have gotten him into this predicament by booking a flight with Delta. Delta? Never again!"

My boyfriend and I flew out of PA, had a layover in Atlanta, and then was supposed to get to Orlando from there. There was issues with the luggage in PA and engine problems which took over an hour to figure out, we ended up missing our layover. Everybody who “helped” us was rude and could not be bothered. Went back and forth 4-5 times with different terminals between different standby flights and then 2 different confirmed ones. Simply would never fly Delta again because of their miserable workers."

Our flight attendant was Jeffrey Tusch and he was an absolute professional. He was kind, engaging, informative, and attentive! We flew United on the way to SFO and those flight attendants couldn’t be bothered to stop talking to one another to serve us drinks or anything else. Also their contactless payment credit card app did not work. I will fly Delta any day of the week. Jeffrey was awesome and it is amazing on how one flight attendant can have such an impact on your perception of the whole airline. Airlines should take notice of how important flight attendants, such as Jeffrey are to the entire customer experience and recognize their efforts appropriately. Delta is now our preferred airline because of him!"

797,4,A330-200,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Atlanta to Honolulu,October 2021,1,4,4,4,4,,1,1,✅ Trip Verified ,"  We upgraded our seats from economy to comfort plus for around $400 per seat. The seats were tight and the plane was a bit aged. Definitely not worth the extra money. We were able to board sooner which means we got overhead storage. The leg room was maybe 2-3 inches more but the seat width was narrow. Also, the arm against the window doesn't go up which dug into my leg the entire flight. Either go economy and save your money or pay for first class. This plane (DL427) should not be used for a 10 hour flight. Time for this plane to be refurbished or placed on shorter routes."

We have a plan B but will wait another 30 minutes to see if it clears up. It was obvious it was not going to get better. After 30 minutes we were told we are going with plan B just waiting to get more fuel. We took off nearly an hour late and flew a different route which took longer. We arrived in SLC 10 minutes after our connecting and last flight for the day to San Diego. We were told to go to the Delta help desk. While waiting in line we here a team member tell the two ladies in front of us that he will provide them with hotel rooms an upgrade to comfort plus. When we go to the next available service rep and ask about accommodations she says, “we don’t do that for weather events”. I have two issues with this. 1. This was initially a weather event, but waiting for 30 minutes before requesting fuel for a plan B that was that everyone knew would have to happen is what caused us to miss the flight. 2. If “we don’t do that for weather events” why did one service rep do it for at least two different groups? So we spent the night in the airport and when we got on the plane our group of 4 who paid extra for each ticket so we could be together was placed all over the place. Not one of us was with another. Very unhappy about this situation."

The attendant angrily told me that my seat was given away because of the delay. However, after I was forced to take this seat, at least 8 other people came on board and I noticed at least 2 who still got choice seats in my section. I was offered a middle seat which caused me distress and pain and injury to my shoulder. I had surgery recently and needed my shoulders to be free and also have another medical diagnosis that requires me to seat in aisle seat. I am very disappointed."

On the way home I had the worst flight experience I'd ever had. We had just landed in Salt Lake and our plane to Minneapolis was already boarding. I was 7 and a half months pregnant running to the gate. I had to use the restroom so bad and I was having horrible pain. When we were almost to the gate we realized that for some reason I had been placed on a separate flight from the rest of my family. So that I did not have to be alone while this far along and in pain my dad, in front of the two gate employees gave me his boarding pass. This caused a lot of problems and delayed the flight. Everyone was talking about me and I was having a panic attack. The captain tried to convince me to get off the plane and made me feel bad for having him rewrite my ticket. The plane ride was bumpy, I was in pain and I was having a horrible panic attack. After being in the air for awhile I calmed down and was able to relax. To top it off as I was leaving the flight, the flight attendants rudely mentioned, as they were right next to me that someone who was not supposed to be there delayed the flight. Even though I was originally on a different flight, Delta never apologized for isolating a 7 and a half month pregnant woman from her babies father and the rest of her family for no reason. Did nothing to make me feel better. And everyone was extremely rude. I don't understand this and I will not be flying with Delta again. The worst flying experience I have ever. "

Two weeks later? His still shows up, but mine now says $0. They just took away over $200 of credit!? I’ve tried on the app, I’ve tried on my computer, nothing. And now I have to spend hours waiting, calling, texting to hopefully get it sorted. How is this a professional company! I honestly will never fly them again after this.

Hands down the worst airline in existence and should be ashamed to even call themselves an airline. Despite registering my flight 4 months in advance, they changed my flight plan 6 times without my permission. They just sent me an email saying that it is changed and didn't do anything about it. I tried calling customer service to get my original flight plan back after each time it was changed, but they put my on hold for 6 hours and never picked up. I'm surprised they didn't change my flight time the day of the flight, because they changed it 3 days before. My original flight plan was supposed to last 9 hours from Portland to Boston. It turned out to be a 16 hour flight due to the changed flight schedule and layovers. I spent over $700 for a flight without many layovers and they change it to a flight that's probably worth $400 max."

This once great airline has devolved into a low service carrier. A nearly 6 hour flight and a drink was served in a plastic cup and the ‘meal”, the “lunch” was a choice of three things in a box. I have been on many flights of varying lengths lately and this “ offering” is the sorriest excuse I have experienced yet. The website says lunch would be served and I ended up with a tiny salad in a box. The scene inside terminal two at LAX resembled a third world terminal in its chaos and dis order.

Then, our plane in Atlanta that had sat there all day when maintenance could have been performed was deemed to be unworthy to fly. They waited 5 hours for another plane and wouldn’t help us transfer to other flights. They did “rebook” our adjoining flights we were missing. Then, when we got to that flight, we were not booked.

I fly thousands of miles every year normally on United where the service is so much better I avoid Delta whenever possible and today I am reminded again why. Who likes to be treated with disdain and an inconvenience. Apparently the Delta staff have forgotten that I pay for their rent every time I purchase a ticket.

814,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Rome via New York JFK and Amsterdam,September 2021,1,3,1,1,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," I purchased tickets through Alitalia for the Alitalia/Delta partnership with economy ticket seats for travel between Boston and New York JFK and premium ticket seats for the transatlantic flights between New York and Rome Italy. The transatlantic flights were to be on Alitalia, however on September 1 with a hurricane approaching the northeast coast forced a closure of JFK NY airport. As a result Delta offered an alternative flight from Boston to Amsterdam and then to my final destination, Rome. This avoided New York and the hurricane altogether. I thought my departure and arrival problems were resolved until: 1) Although I paid for a premium transatlantic seat, I was given an economy seat. I specifically asked the attendant at the boarding gate to confirm that I had a premium seat. He said I did which was not true and I discovered this after I boarded the plane. Therefore, I can only conclude that the individual at the desk either outright lied or was completely incompetent. Either way he did not care one bit about the customer. 2) Delta delayed my luggage. I arrived in Rome on Thursday. I did not receive my luggage until the following Monday. 3) I tried to get a partial reimbursement from Delta for the cost difference between the economy seat and the premium seat. They have told me that although they were the ones who made the mistake, they could not provide a partial refund and that I would need to go through Alitalia. To date Delta has not provided any assistance in obtaining my partial refund. In fact they have only wasted my time with numerous phone calls with very lengthy waiting time on the phone. Lastly, it took them more then a week to get back to me and tell me that Delta could not help and that I must go through Alitalia. The representative on the phone chose to argue with me rather than help. I was neither rude nor aggressive on the phone since I know that would not have helped. I am still waiting to hear back from Delta or Alitalia. No refund yet. At present I will choose not to fly Delta and that will hold true for Alitalia since they are going out of business in the near future. To be continued."
815,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,October 2021,1,1,,,1,,1,0,Not Verified ,  How does it make any sense for Delta to switch seats that you have chosen in advance and put some random person between you and your family members. How could you possibly know if that person you are putting next to us is ill or carrying a virus. Three of us flying together and they moved all of us in different seats away from each other to sit next to strangers. Way to control COVID Delta.

I went from having a roundtrip non-stop flight to having stops both ways and about 8 hours added to my trip. When I tried to get assistance for this their response was pretty much too bad, its out of our control. Mind you they have non-stop flights for those exact dates with only like 2 hour difference, but they decided to give a much less desirable flight and all they could offer me was changing to a non-stop flight 3 days later for an extra $100.

We missed our flight back from Hawaii to Michigan. Our baggage stayed on that flight. It arrived at 7am in the morning and they put it in an office for us. We took another flight back, got in at 1p. We came to pick up both of our suitcases (2 of them), and 1 of them were not there. They have no clue what happened to it. They tells use only 3 people have access to where the bags were that day. Not a single one of them know what happened to the bag. They tell us there are no cameras. They tell us there is nothing they can do for us.  Jackie at Detroit metro airport Delta lost baggage was helpful. But she was also useless. She literally told me at one point that it's possible it grew legs and walked out because no one here would steal it.  We filed a claim. We filed a police report. Nothing. No one is helpful. They just give false possibilities. "

At no point would it let us pick our seats (like they said we could) the night before the flight we check our app and I am located at the very front of the plane and my husband is located at the very back of the plane, even though the tickets were bought at the same time. We called the customer service twice where ones we were hung up on out of nowhere in the middle of our call, and the second being told there was nothing they could do. Unless we paid close to $100 per option. We could pay almost $100 extra a piece to sit together or pay almost $100 a piece to cancel. They said we could have a flight credit but have to pay the cancellation fees. What is the point in the credit it were paying more total for the cancellation. Or what was the point in buying tickets together. We will NOT be flying again. To be a ""high end"" air service we have been treated very unprofessionally."

A few months back I lost my car and house keys in TSA. I called back to verify that I left them in TSA and was told they had them. After my trip I went home and they couldn’t find my keys. I had to pay $300 for a new key for them to call me back the next day and tell me they had them which I already knew. Now this month I book a flight with them and they kept delaying it. I ended up booking with a new airline because I had already missed a day a work due to there delays and didn’t get a chance to cancel the flight due to the person at the desk telling me I needed to call customer service. 10 days have passed and I’ve called customer service and now my ticket isn’t available to be an e ticket or voucher. So I am completely done with Delta.

Rumor has it that if the plane is not full they will cancel no matter the airline. If this is the case then stop booking morning flights. I see my daughter a couple times a year so an afternoon down the drain because of a canceled flight is a big deal. Then you call and the airlines dont want to help, They say they have no control, they do not offer refunds, they only give excuses that you can have a later flight or next day flight which may get canceled too. I pay good money to have her fly home and for me to fly out there and I am tired of this happening every time and no one cares.

We fly Delta always! Have been Delta Platinum card members for years! We used to not care if another airline was a little more expensive because we are loyal Frequent Flyers. We are learning this means little to nothing to Delta. We had a flight to Cabo San Lucas non stop, round trip in Delta comfort that was cancelled by the airline and replaced with a very inconvenient and lengthy route and main cabin seats. The flights we had scheduled to fly originally had not been cancelled they simply moved us and down graded cabin to the other flights! We were to fly home from Cabo to Salt Lake City for a five hour layover and leaving at midnight to Atlanta arriving at 5am. This is wrong. So they refunded us for the difference in airfare after we called them on it and returned us to our original return flight. Months ago I made round trip Delta Comfort (first class was full) flights to Rome ahead of our cruise in Europe next May. Today we noticed that the reservations are no more in our “My Trips”. And of course you can’t talk with a human being any longer. So we can no longer be assured that a reservation on Delta will be honored."
826,3,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kona to San Jose,September 2021,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,0,Not Verified ,"  We flew from Koa, Hawaii to San Jose, California and it took almost 11 hours. It seemed like we passed SFO and than made our way to Washington with a 1 hour layover. That added 5 hours to our travel time and seemed unnecessary to not stop in San Jose first. We flew American Airlines to Hawaii and Delta on the way home, comparing the 2 AMERICAN was way more comfortable seating with more leg room and their flight attendants were really friendly and genuinely excited to take you to Hawaii. Delta was a different feel the flight attendants didn't really seem to want to be there, they offered drinks 1 time on a 5 hour flight and the seating was very uncomfortable. Our knees were almost touching the seats in front of us. There were TVs on each rest for our long flight from Hawaii but not from Washington to San Jose. That was a smaller plane and you felt turbulence a lot more in the smaller plane. Wifi did not work for texting either flight. I understand over the ocean it doesn’t work but it didn’t work over the mountains either. Honestly I don’t think we will fly Delta anymore regardless of price. They did do a good job helping my grandma in a wheel chair and I appreciate that. Btw their prices change the more you look at the ticket prices. For whatever reason it was different pricing for each of us depending on if I looked on my phone again or on a tablet like I was a whole new person."

I asked if they were going to guarantee my laptop, camera equipment and my Bose headphones. Total of about 5k worth of equipment. The lady at the counter rudely said we guarantee nothing but I was free to carry the contents of the bag without the bag. We get on the plane finally and there's several empty over head bins. 2 minutes before we leave a Delta employee takes the seat next to me and of course he has not one but 2 full size carry on bags. I've been a sky miles member for a few years but you can keep the miles. I'll not be giving you any more of my business."

Their app will increase the price of the ticket if you look at it more than once (each time you look for an option and don't buy immediately - it will double the price by the hour). Its so evident, they should be ashamed to abuse their own potential clients. The app will always tell you that there is only one or two tickets left, to pressure you into paying ridiculously high rates. Then, when you board the plane, its half empty. Please avoid being robbed by Delta."

During my 7.5 hour flight from Atlanta to Anchorage the WiFi was not working and the TV was not working. When I brought this to the attention of the flight attendant she acted like I was an inconvenience. She was also very rude to the other passengers as well. I am currently sitting in the Anchorage airport waiting to return to Orlando and they are not staffed at the check in desk. I have 10 other passengers with me currently. They do not have a phone number provided to call for service. The other airlines near by say that the Delta employees commonly do not pay attention to there check in desks. Before booking my flight I received the delta airlines credit card thinking I will continue using this company. I will be closing my credit account and I suggest everyone pay extra to use a different airline.

The captain personally announced in the waiting area that there would be a slight delay due to a mechanical problem. When the problem was fixed, he announced that the problem was repaired and assured us that the aircraft was ready to fly. So nice to hear these announcements from the captain. Usually the gate agents make these announcements. The snack service consisted of a box of crackers, cheese and sweets. Nothing to brag about, but understandable due to covid."

Because of that we elected to pay the xtra money & fly 1st class. Come travel day we get on plane & we were Surprised to say the least. We paid over $1800 a little wider seat and extra 2 inches of leg room. Now on to the flight which was fine except previously mentioned items. We requested a wheelchair at every stop. At Salt Lake NO help at gate. Finally got someone to push & thank god as we had 38 minutes to get all way across the airport. That whole experience at SLC was brutal. Due construction we had to climb up & down to get to bus to take us to plane. And we had no help getting to car rental once In Omaha. All in all flying Delta was easily the worst experience we have had. My wife & I are in our 60’s and do lot’s of traveling. Rest assured my wife & I will NOT fly Delta ever again.

My flight was delayed 6 times, at one point I went to the desk to see what the problem was and I was given a $15 voucher for food. The second time I went to the desk I was told I was going to be on the next flight, not only was I not on that flight but I was told that flight was full. I called customer service and spoke to someone there and the person I spoke to tried to tell me they didn’t see a delay, I was very angry at this point and called the person a liar because I had 6 emails from them telling me my flight had been delayed 6 times. I was in that airport in Knoxville for nine hours, from 4.45 am to 2.00 pm and not once did I feel like myself or some of the other passengers who were also delayed were a priority.

The state of their customer service is abysmal, and the last 3 flights I've had with them have all had delays and one even cancelled. They offer no support for getting updated covid tests if you are travelling overseas as well. I just had to spend almost $100 on ubers in a layover city to get a test because of these delays, and they refuse to reimburse me for that.

We sprinted across the airport to catch the next flight to ICT. We arrived 1 minute after the gate closed and they refused to let us on. They had to put us up in two rooms and pay for our drinks and meals. How much does that cost them? A lot more than opening the door when the plane hadn’t even moved. That’s okay they don’t care if they go bankrupt we (the government) will always bail them out. Maybe if our weak government quits bailing them out they would have better service and run their business better - utterly ridiculous!

JAC-MSP delay was caused by waiting for a fuel truck. MSP-LGA was due to change in flight plan. LGA-ROC because we were stuck on the tarmac for 45 minutes. All segments were full. Flight crews were okay. I can't really complain or rave. Pro Tip: The first row of Delta's Comfort Plus on their domestic Airbus and Embraer E-175 aircraft have more legroom that their domestic first class seats. IFE was okay, I forgot to bring my headphones but that's okay. I did not use their Wi-Fi. The on board flight tracker kept me amused along with their BlackJack game app. Overall impression: Not great, but not awful either. Delays not Delta's fault."

We paid extra to be in main cabin and we are the ones who had to check our bags. The ones who didn't pay extra didn't have to check their bags. I am very upset about this and will never fly Delta again if I can help it. They used the covid excuse. Had nothing to do with covid.

I just happened to be looking at our itineraries online to make transportation arrangements on the ground & saw this. No call to ask would he like to pay xtra to remain on the same flight or put in coach for the same price…nope, we’ll just separate the family & screw up my birthday dinner reservations on the ground. Forget about the time I took meticulously booking him online myself in order to avoid the ungodly wait time of having a delta agent help me. Forget about the fact that Delta left him Atlanta in April this year knowing full well he was expected. Forget about the fact that we spent 4 hrs driving him bk & forth to Orlando so he could have less plane changes (more direct flight) to have Delta change his return trip & add another stop when I could have booked him myself directly from Melbourne & had the same amount of stops and he’d be home instead of us losing 4 more hours of our lives driving back and forth to a diff airport for no reason now. I paid xtra for comf+ but it would be an even trade to get him in coach (row 32) in a middle seat because that’s all they have available. So much for being a loyal Delta flyer for 30 years!

We were given $200 gift certificates to fly Delta for our honeymoon. Booked our flights a couple of months in advance. Just a couple of weeks before departure, Delta changed our return flight from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. This didn't work for us. I was on hold with Delta for over 7 hours. When I finally spoke with a representative - she said she would refund our return flights and keep our departure flights. The gift cards would be applied to the departure flights. So she cancelled our flight but couldn't get the refund to process. I was transferred to a different representative where I sat on hold for an additional 5 hours! That representative told me that he couldn't process a refund he'd have to keep our departure flights and refund our gift cards - applying them to our departure flight wasn't an option unless they cancelled both flights and then rebooked the departure flight. I asked how long it would take and he assured me that it would be within 7 days. We are long past 7 days ... we have no refund, no departure flight and flights have now more than doubled in cost! We called Delta today who told us that it could actually take us up to 30 days to see our refund - which is after our trip, and that they would not honor the original ticket pricing and that we'd now have to pay more than double for our departure flight. Not to mention we'd paid a couple hundred dollars extra for a different return flight with another airline at such late notice. So we're literally out thousands of dollars - do not have a flight to our honeymoon in a couple of weeks and Delta won't do anything. "

It has come to the point where I give myself a 12-hour schedule flexibility in order to accommodate Delta’s reputation with shifting schedules. The worst part about it is that they do it on purpose because they way overbook and do other low quality tactics to save their business money while putting passenger satisfaction last. Did I mention that their WiFi NEVER works? I don’t even try anymore. It has worked literally 0% of the time with a sample size of about 8 flights I remember. Try your hardest to fly anyone else.

There is absolutely no reason for there not to be a pilot or crew to fly these planes, you’re able to offer these flights so maybe you should staff them accordingly.

Delta is clearly not a superior carrier than American, or southwest. We will never refer any family or friends, nor spend another cent with delta."

I was given an options and I chose a virtual visa card which was to be issued by Black Hawk. I've been dealing with Delta and Black Hawk. Delta said they cannot do anything on their end once they issued the voucher for $600. Grew Hawk said they have received nothing. Dealing with two big companies, not one will take ownership! Think twice before giving up your seat!"

The first class seats are advertised as beds, but as a seat they are no bigger than coach. Truly. When I arrived at our seats we were shocked. We asked the attendant where is first class? We sat down in our coach size seats and I asked, where is my pillow and blanket? The attendant says we don't have any. Then we were offered the choice of two sandwiches for a 4+ hour flight. I don't eat sandwiches. I expected to get service like American at least and be offered a cheese plate, but no, that was it, an Italian sandwich. No drink service any more in first class I guess. I asked for a drink and was told ""not until we are in the air and the food service starts"". I have three trips coming up. Unfortunately, Delta is a hub in SLC. American is not much better, but I would rather connect than fly Delta ever again."

The bus was late from the parking deck and the line was as enormous due to the holiday the manager was not willing to even listen to us instead basically said it was nothing you can do either reschedule or leave another day. I asked if the luggage can just be placed on the next plane she refused, we asked if we can check it once boarding a plane that was denied as well. She was rude and uncalled for, we had to push our check in back another day leaving remaining family stranded in LA without a place to go. I will never fly Delta again."

The attendants were rude, non accommodating, no wine. No champagne, nothing, did not tend to passengers, constant flow of passengers from coach using first class toilet. The foul smell of toilet usage was overwhelming, bathrooms filthy. Constant flow of people with attendants not redirecting the usage. When you fly first class you expect just that, I understand the high ticket price and more than willing to pay but expect first class service. As a result, I will never fly Delta for either person so it business flights. By the way, I sent my dissatisfaction at the time, never received a response from Delta."

They had 3 operators receiving around 200 people. It was at 8.30 am when one of the operators came up with the great idea of ​​moving the people who had left the flight out of the line. Very quietly they asked me to return the next day, I refused because the next day I had a flight connection to another city to have my final destination. It was then that the Delta Airlines operator offered me a flight at 1.30 pm but I had to take a taxi to JFK Airport ($ 80 from my packet). Until then I thought, well, we are human beings and we make mistakes. It was then on my return from Cali Colombia when I was checking my luggage and the operator tells me that my carry-on bag does not meet the requirements on the aircraft. I brought carry-on from NY to Cali in hand but my carry-on bag could no longer return in the same way so the operator said he was holding it for me and I had to pay $120 dollars (they charged me $ 127 dollars). But Delta Airlines was not happy enough with the damage that occurred so far, when I arrived in Bogota, a stopover place, I took the opportunity to buy two bottles of liquor which were delivered to me on the plane, sealed in plastic bags, the plane had a delay of 2 hours and a half in Bogota because they had not put fuel, they had to wait for the takeoff authorization signature and this together took about three hours. My next stop was Atlanta , where a Delta operator received us shouting and I think he was going to hit us, trying to hurry us without the right to ask anything. Immigration passed, then the scan part, and that was when an officer told me that I could not take my two bottles of liquor, because they did not fit in the scanner and He threw them in the garbage"". as simple as that."

I did not choose this route, Delta cancelled the direct flights after I hade made the booking. Ok, there is a lot of paperwork and checking necessary at this time. I arrived at the airport in the time specified, only to find very few agents manning the booths, there was a long line at the Sky Priority desk, I'm quite sure 99% were not Sky Priority. After about a 30 minute wait, the line had hardly moved. At this point, I decided to jump the queue, as I am a Sky Priority passenger and was served as next in line (I normally do not do this). The same thing happened at Schiphol - at one point, there was only one person checking the paperwork for a full flight to the US, I suppose 300/400 people. I got through this line a little quicker, as I had left the lounge a lot earlier than I would normally do. Airlines pride themselves on Customer Service, well Customer Service starts as soon as you enter the airport. I have flown a lot over the years, mainly on Delta and their partner airlines, so I know what service should look like. Cabin service was ok, not particularly good. I am 86 and my wife is 84 and we select our routes, carefully with plenty of layover time, so we can have hassle free experiences. The ground experience was not one of those trips. The outgoing legs worked just fine."

She urged us to come to the counter to check bags, so my wife went to check a bag. Little did we know that she would be forced to get on board. She had left a personal bag with me thinking we would board later together. Now I had three bags, one of which were hers. Upon trying to board (after a surprise text from my wife), I was told I had to either consolidate or check a bag. I was threatened that I would not be able to board until I checked our fragile souvenirs (there are just too many threats from this airline). I was extremely disappointed that Delta would created a situation like this which was completely avoidable. And that really happened because we were cooperating with them asking us to check our bags. It was truly a shame because at least their aircraft was very nice."

It was the most uncomfortable and most unprofessional airline I’ve ever traveled with. It took two days to get to my destination.

I arrived over an hour before my flight to find a line to check bags formed outside the airport entrance. When I finally got to the counter I was 5 minutes over, due to their poor planning, and the agent refused to let me check-in. Told me I’d have to take a later flight and sent me to “special services” when I explained I have been here and in line for over 30 minutes she said it wasn’t her problem. I asked where special services was and she said “that large group of people of there”. I explained that this whole area is one large group of people, can you be more specific. Her response was “figure it out”. If that was deplorable enough, I then sat in the special services line for 40 minutes. Missing my flight. I was Confused as to why this line was also taking forever. To my shock, When I was at the top of the time to get the next special service agent the agent called not 1 but 2 regular bag drop passengers before he called me. I saw another special service agent do the same. At this point I’m furious and holding back tears when the agent says - sorry you missed your first flight and the next 3 are booked. I explain I have a wedding and I need to be on the 9am and she tells me there’s nothing she can do. My entire day is wrecked, I will be missing the services of a wedding I am in and the Delta agents couldn’t have been ruder, unapologetic or less empathetic for the destruction they created. Terrible customer service."

First of all my ticket for the connection domestic flight was changed twice, and I was never asked if this was ok. The last changed was giving me no time to board the international flight, and also was not giving time for the people on the runway to transfer my suitcases from one plane to the other. Customer service rep resolved my problem, and I’m back on my original flight. The second problem I had, when I had to cancel my flight in April, because of increasing cases of Covid, I was charged a fee, the rep again resolved my problem, and gave me a refund.

Got to gate in ATL where I met 3 others who were there 15 min before departure time on DL5189 to Gainesville, but rude/crude gate attendant had shut door. Her response was too bad. Southwest would never have done such a thing. Another reminder to avoid Delta. Someone else paid for my flight or I would not have used Delta.

Then the flight from Atlanta to Sao Paulo (Brazil) got delayed for 1 hr. Leading me to miss my connecting flight from Sao Paulo to Montevideo. I then had to stay 3 days in Sao Paulo, Delta covered all accommodations including hotel stay, meals and transportation. Regardless of this, the last thing I wanted after 17 hrs of flights and being at airports was to stay in a hotel in a foreign city with nothing to do. Not to mention that the food served on that flight was disgusting to say the least. It's a 5/10 just because of how accommodating they were under the circumstances, but could've been prevented all throughout."

My suitcase, despite literally being dropped right at the entrance of the plane, was sent to Minneapolis. I only learned this today after almost 18 hours and no one from Delta is reaching out to me. Baggage claim assistants were not useful at all in JFK. My company laptop and phone were in that bag, and I have no confirmation that my equipment was not tampered with. I’ve been waiting for almost 7 hours for a rep to reach out to me with the text service, and when I was able to get a rep by calling, the call dropped in minutes. Calling again now and the wait is 2 hours. Between the baggage assistants, the terminal worker who told me no my stuff was in baggage claim, not being able to speak to anyone since leaving the airport for a real update, this has been the worst customer service experience I’ve ever had. The WiFi was bad too."
882,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Elmira to Orlando,July 2021,1,2,1,3,1,1,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ," This is the first time I have flown with Delta. Me and my family flew from Elmira NY to Orlando Fl. Before we even left for our trip they changed our flights 5 times. As well as changing the layovers. Our trip finally got here we made it to Florida. It cost me $90 for checked baggage. The flight down wasn't too bad. They didn't offer anything special in flight. We did notice they messed up someone else's tickets and seats as well. Assigning the same seats to more than one person. When it was time for us to fly home from Florida we got to the airport and they told us it was too late for them to check our baggage and that we would have to be put on standby. Noting that there were 3 of us and only one flight going out at 4 pm and the connecting flight in Detroit only had one flight that day as well. Again leaving us on stand by for 3 people stranded without a connecting flight. And our original flight was to leave at 8.20 am from Orlando. So basically leaving us stranded in Orlando with no flight. The lady at the counter was rude, acted like she could not care less, and did not explain the process at all to us. She hurried us through and pushed us away. Leaving us with more questions than answers. We had to ask someone else, then stand in the long line again to get another agent to explain the whole standby process to us. To tell us that our chances of all three of us getting a seat on the next flight was very slim to none. We could not wait another day or two in a Florida airport nor Detroit to get a flight home when I had a 14 yr old son with me as well as having to be at work and having to get home to our animals. So we ended up having to spend more money to rent a car to drive home from Orlando Florida to New York so we were not stuck in an airport for days waiting for Delta to get us a flight. So not only did they cost me my airfare home but I had to spend money on a rental car that was another $400. I have never had such a hard time with an airline. And I have flown many times. This was my first and last time flying with Delta. Apparently my family has had the same problem with them. I will stick with my other airline from now on! This was a horrible experience."

You are setting yourself up for hours of pure frustration if you purchase a ticket with Delta. Never mind just the rude attendants or gate people but really what will get you is the pure inability to get through to company if you need any customer service. Once you have purchased ticket only luck will save you because you surely have no guarantee you will ever reach customer service either by phone or online chat. I know this because i have logged 10 hours of my time trying to get though to change ticket because they randomly changed flight time.

I can say with certainty that I will never fly delta airlines again. My flight was booked. About 12 hours before takeoff I received a text message notifying me that my flight was delayed 3 hours. Not a big deal except I had a connector flight in Salt Lake City, going to Jackson Hole, so now I would miss that flight. After calling and sitting on hold for over 3 hours I was finally in contact with someone. They then gave me an option of flying the entire day with long layovers and arriving at 8pm or a flight with two layovers but that arrival time would be similar to my original flight (12pm). Once showing up to the gate, my seat was assigned and I was put in the last row of the plane. In the middle seat next to the bathroom. Two hours to Detroit. Now 4 hour flight to Salt Lake City from Detroit my ticket says seat assigned at gate. And guess what, same thing. Now to top it off they make me check my bag at the gate. I get on the plane and every single over head bin had multiple vacancies for bags. Not sure why I had to check my bag. I tried to get my seat or flight switched to no avail.

We were of course very excited being our first time there and this was our second trip together as a couple. We started at Grand Rapids and had 1 stop at Detroit then to New Orleans. The flight from Grand Rapids to Detroit was great. The flight from Detroit then to New Orleans was horrible. I was surprised to find no TV screen in first class for that long of a flight? Very disappointing. then we noticed the silver ceiling tile about the rest room was falling down on 1 side. Not a good thing to see the airplane falling apart. Our trip back was not any better! Again leaving from to Detroit in first class with no TV screen. Then we land in Detroit to find we have a change in flight and are stuck at the airport for 3 hours till they had another plane. We finally board and are being told they are all about safety and keeping things sanitized. Thats a joke! We get to our first class seat to find finger prints on the window, dirty hand prints on side walk and arm rest and garbage in seat pocket. Then again still no TV screen. The flight attendants were being very rude and harassing customers about everything .. we all just wanted to get to our last stop. You would think they would be more understanding that we had a 3 hour delay! I was told to push my purse further under seat in front of me ... yea 2 inches really made a difference there. When we landed in Grand Rapids the ceiling panel above us came down and the flight attendant had to push it back up.  We felt totally unsafe on your plane. I made a complaint to delta. In the email it said I would hear from you in 14-21 days its been past that. So thought maybe if I leave this review I'll hear from someone.."

My initial flight was late to get me then my second flight left without me followed by having to wait till 10 pm ish to catch the next flight to my destination. One would assume that an airline as large as delta likes to be good at what they do but I guess quality went out the door with COVID. Staffing issues also seem to be a problem. Calling in to reschedule my return flight and I’m told the wait time is over an hour? Seriously, I would imagine that Delta can afford to staff their call center well enough to be convenient instead of a hassle. Unfortunately it’s been this was for years. Often times it’s quicker fro me to drive to the airport to get my flight changed than it is for me to wait on the phone."

The representative that changed them gave us a flight with a 54 minute layover saying it would be easy to make our connection without telling us he put us in the very back row of the plane and that we had two very far gates from each other. No one would assist us to make our connection easier. My biggest complaint is that they put my two year old in a row by herself, without me or my husband. They would not change her seat. This is very very unsafe to have a two year old next to strangers and also very upsetting to everyone in the seats around us. We shouldn't have to rely on someone us to give up their seats so we can sit with our two year old! I will be looking into laws and regulations on this and filing a complaint wherever I can about this action."
888,1,,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Frankfurt,August 2021,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,  Absolutely the worst airline! Flight attendants are rude and laugh when you have an issue like my screen not working and basically just say you are out of luck. The airline allows car seats on the plane which means if you are as unfortunate as me then you can’t put your seat back to sleep even though it’s an overnight flight and when landing in the morning with no sleep having to proceed your drive home a few hrs away. They do not enforce a calm and relaxing flight. I spend just as much money as anyone else on my tickets to not receive a working screen and unable to put my seat back to sleep. Will never fly again and do not recommend for anyone. The airline should really learn what hospitality means.

The pilot came on the speaker saying that now we not only were missing a flight attendant, but also that fuel was low and they needed to dispatch someone out to put fuel for the plane. That took another 45 minutes. Waiting on a plane that hasn’t even taken off yet. This flight is only 1 hour."

The priority lane to go through security was closed but due to the fact that the airport wasn’t dead I went through in 15 minutes towards the Sky Club. Where I was actually welcomed. Boarding was very prompt and service onboard was impeccable which made up for the guy at check in being careless. Seats were comfy for the 5.5 hour flight. Due to restrictions sandwiches were served as a meal but nonetheless very tasty and about every half hour cabin crew came by to refill drinks and whatever else was needed, about an hour before landing snacks were handed out. What made this flight memorable was the attention given by crew members."

The first time flying out of LGA to FLL the desk lady was snapping on everyone that would go up to ask for their seat, but at least there was a monitor that eventually showed seat assignments. Upon my return there was no way of knowing what the seat assignments were. I went up to the lady behind the counter greeted her and she turned her face to me. Finally she looks over with an annoyed face and I ask her if they had assigned seats. She basically told me to check my app and when I told her I don’t have the app I have an e-tickets on my phone via Apple wallet she just said I’d have to wait to board once they call for all remaining passengers. I’m fuming I’ve never been in such a weird boarding situation before both times encountering extremely rude employees. Delta train your employees to be a little nicer and develop a better seating system please. Never flying Delta again."

I’m currently on hold for a single question I had. I’ve been on hold for an hour and 20 minutes when they said “our estimated wait time is 13 minutes” That’s 6X wrong and also made it so I couldn’t bring something I needed to with me because I wasn’t sure if it was allowed or not. I allowed 30 minutes to speak to someone before I had to leave, I guess I should’ve assumed it would be more like a 1.5 hour hold+. My flight was also delayed by 3 hours, no surprise, so I wonder how I’ll make my next flight considering there was a 1 hour layover and that one is on time. I sure hope they make me wait a few more hours to figure that out. Remember, time is money, and Delta couldn’t possibly care less about your time as a customer because then they’d have to hire more people and that wouldn’t help their margins and stock price. Delta doesn’t and never has cared about the customer, this is my 3rd time in a row I’ve had an issue with them. "

When flying with this airline a certain level of quality is expected and I am disappointed. It started out with the flight being delayed until they had access to a full crew and departure time was pushed by twice for that purpose. Then the pilot comes out to say due to regulations he could only work a certain number of hours and would not be able to fly the aircraft and we would have to wait for another pilot. Results were that the flight got pushed to the next morning . During the night the departure gate changed 3 times. Once they arrived in the morning they were a pilot short and pushed departure time once again. For those that opted to stay in the airport and wait, the overnight crew was nonchalant and blaise about the whole ordeal. In addition they were ill prepared with pillows blankets and snack boxs and were acting as if they were bothered by even extending that hospitality. They needed to do a lot more in compensation by giving skylines to a free flight, a hot meal and a pillow with blanket."
896,1,,Business,Premium Economy,Los Angeles to Nashville,July 2021,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Our flight (DL386) LAX-BNA on July 25th started off not well. I was traveling with my family (Myself, wife, son & Daughter). My wife was flying first class with my daughter and I was flying comfort plus with my son. Somehow leading up to the flight our seats were changed without any notice. We are traveling with small children and by law they can not sit by themselves. We found out about the seat changes trying to check in 24hrs in advance. We could not fix our seats together and were told (after holding for 6 hours on the phone) to wait until we reached the gate. We arrived at the airport and there was only one gate attendant with a long line of customers. She was not attending to any of them. Finally someone in line spoke up and she was flustered. She dismissed half of the people in line to go sit down. They were told to deal with their issue at the scanning of boarding passes. We were still seat separated from our children. I finally spoke up and she addressed the situation to get us seated together. Our flight departed a bit late and upon approach into BNA our captain notified us that there was heavy weather and we may have to divert to Memphis. He circled three times and aborted the landing at BNA. We landed in Memphis (1/2 hour from BNA) and are notified that we need to refuel before we can go back and to land at BNA as the storm has now cleared. We now hear from the Captain on the PA that he and his cockpit crew have ""timed out"". We are asked to deplane and wait for alternative cockpit crew. Our flight was initially supposed to land at BNA at 5:11pm, It's now 5:55 as we begin to deplane at Memphis. We find ourselves now at an airport with no restaurants open. Our children are starving. I spend $80 buying junk and jerky at the airport store to tide them over. We now hear from the gate that our incoming pilots will not arrive until 8:30pm (which actually turned into 9:45 because of the incoming delayed flight from Atlanta). We contemplate driving ourselves back to BNA, but that would be a 3 hour drive with the kids. We are now held captive in an airport with no food, an extremely long day of travel and no help from Delta staff or crew. They tell us the only thing available at this airport right now is the drinking fountain and then laugh about it. I am extremely disappointed with the lack of planning and customer service coverage the Delta staff. I understand the timing out of pilots, however the situation after the diverted flight should have been handled better. We were not the only parents with upset, hungry and tired children so my feelings here are mutual as all passengers on flight DL386 where unhappy about the lack of customer service and planning. There was nothing offered to snack on let alone to drink. Even as we re-boarded with the new pilot crew. The staff on flight DL386 didn't offer any snacks that we could see from our seats in first class. Yet when the pilots came on board they handed them both large Bistro Snack Boxes. I'm extremely disappointed with Delta and the crew. This situation could have been handled so much better. We finally got to BNA by 10:30pm( 5 hours after our initial arrival time to BNA) It's now 11:30pm by the time we get the kids home. They're now eating at 11:45pm. NOT a great situation or Delta experience to say the LEAST!!We have a choice when we travel. I hope this helps future travelers"

I missed my connecting flight and was forced to spend the night in Detroit airport. When I originally boarded this flight I was reassured by staff that if I missed my connecting flight there would be ticket agents available to find us a hotel and food when we landed. This never happened so as forced to sleep in the airport. Airport staff also threatened me that if I left the airport I would no longer be secure. I have never felt so scared and alone in my life. This was the worst experience of my 45 years of life. It took me over 30 hours to travel from Las Vegas to Buffalo New York. I am astonished with the lack of humanity and respect that I was shown by the staff of Delta Air Lines. It will be a long time before I fly again. Rest assured it will not be with Delta!

I requested a reply, which I haven't received.  I only edited the review by eliminating the religious group to which the two passengers next to me belong. I was sitting on an aisle seat when two young men who I could tell from their attire are of a strict religious group, asked the young man across the aisle, without addressing me, if he and I could switch seats. Due to religious reasons, they wanted to have a man sit there. We both said no, because the man across the aisle was sitting with his wife and son. I suggest airlines screen their passengers better for religious preferences. Furthermore, these two young men took their masks off most of the flight. I told one of the flight attendants, and she told them to put them on, which they did until she left. A passenger behind us also told them to put them on to no avail. Flight attendants walked up and down the aisle and never told them to put their masks on. Personally, I wore two masks which I didn't take off the entire flight even to drink water. Since we had to circle off on the Atlantic due to thunderstorms in South Florida, I was uncomfortable and, of course, thirsty. I went to the lavatory once and noticed that other passengers who were not eating, also had their masks off."

My daughter had a direct flight from Orange County Ca to Atl Ga and somehow got diverted to another airport and no one contacted me, I was sitting at the airport waiting for her when I got a call from her freaking out cause she landed in another airport and she doesn't know why and no one told me anything. After speaking to a manager in the airport from Delta, she told me that my daughter is fine and to calm down she will get there when she gets there and that the weather was so bad that they couldn't land but all the other planes seem to be landing just fine and there was no rain, no black clouds it was clear as day sun shinning and 95 out. But the weather was so bad they landed somewhere else and then didn't contact her mother ever even after they sat there for 3 hours. On top of that my daughter was on the phone crying and the flight attendant told her to stop crying and that she was fine and freaking out for no reason. Thank god there was a Mom sitting behind her with her kids who stuck up for her and reassured her that it was going to be ok and that she was there if she needed anything. We fly with southwest and pay 50 dollar unaccompanied minor fee and have never had an issue they tell us if they are running late or even when she has had a not direct flight and they land and change planes the flight attendant will text you and let you know all is well. I have contacted them but I just do not want another child and parent to go through this don't fly your unaccompanied minor with Delta."

We were clicking around trying to find the best flights, and thought we had. Turns out once we clicked back, the dates changed and so did the traveler names (my wife was booking for me and my boys and ended up booking for herself and the boys, and the dates changed by a month!). Tried to call Delta and the hold time was 9 hours! Tried the chat and couldn't get a live person. Ended up missing our 24 hours free cancellation window and had to pay $50 to change my name, but they forgot to change the dates. Now another 9 hours on hold to update to the correct date.

He also stood over my 21 and 23 year old daughters while they were eating to make sure they were pulling it up between bites. Every few minutes they come across the loudspeaker reminding you to keep it up no matter what even in between bites or you will be removed from the plane.

It started bad, on the the plane for several hours at LAX waiting for take off, while they fixed the problem of ""a door not closing"". By the time I got to JHK late that night, I had of course missed my connecting flight to TLV. We were given vouchers ""for the hotel"". Us four stranded parties went to that Airport Holiday Inn, only to find when we got there that the vouchers were not for the room - as the typical credit card number was not on it. Turns out, we were mislead as these were only to get a rate. One of the parties had to sleep in the lobby because there was in fact no room. Further, because of this passage of time, we has to retake the COVID-test ($225) the next day on top of paying the hotel ($150) and lose a day in travel. When I went to be reimbursed, the airline (the ""we care team"" - which I prefer to think of as ""We could not care less team"") declined to do so, saying a passenger had caused the door problem and therefore they could evoke an act of god ""Force Majeure"" exemption not to compensate - a first in all my travels!

908,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ontario to Atlanta,July 2021,2,2,3,3,1,3,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Worst airline experience ever! I’ve flown many different airlines before, but I’ve never had so many problems like I have with Delta. This was my first and LAST time flying Delta. I had originally booked a roundtrip, direct flight from ONT to ATL months in advance. Then, a few weeks before, the scheduled flight Delta kept changing my return home flight time (3 times). Eventually they had changed it from a departure time of 5pm to 8am, which is a huge difference in time change. Not only did they change the time, but they changed the return airport from ONT to LAX! I was not ok with either of these drastic changes to the flight I originally booked. I called a Delta representative and told him what had happened. He told me he could make the changes and reschedule me to a direct 4:30pm flight. I assumed things were fixed. It wasn’t until the day before my return flight, when I was supposed to check in, did I realize that he still had my flight booked for the wrong airport (LAX). I then had to spent over 3 hrs on hold waiting to speak to a Delta customer service representative, and over a half hour talking to someone to get my flight fixed. She told me all the direct flights to ONT were sold out, and I would have to take a connecting flight which would be later in the evening arriving to ONT at 11:30pm. I asked if I could wait for standby on a direct flight at 5:50pm. She said she would put me on the list for standby. I was waiting early for standby at the airport until all passengers had finished boarding, as I was directed by the gate Delta attendant. They even said there was one seat that I could take, but when they tried adding me to the seat, they said there was a problem. The system couldn’t give me a direct flight because I only paid for a connecting flight. When I showed them that I did pay for a direct flight they said the representative who booked me this morning did it wrong then. And there was nothing they could do for me. No one tried to compensate me for all of the problems Delta caused with my flight. I feel very unappreciated as a customer. I plan to use other airlines that value their customers time and money from now on."

It was nice to have those screens to watch stuff and play games on. Almost everything about it was great. Most of the flight attendants were really nice. But there was one who was awful. Made fun of me to other people for not being able to find a button. She made me feel uncomfortable the whole flight and the people who were sitting across the aisle from me are who she made fun of me to, so it felt really awkward sitting by them too. She shouldn't be talking about people like that, especially since she doesn't know what they might have. I have a learning disability that can make it harder to understand things. I know there are plenty of people who do where it's hard to see that they have a disability and I wouldn't be surprised at all if she acts like that with far more people. Regardless of whether someone has a disability or not, it's not okay to treat people like that, especially customers. She certainly was by far the worst of any of the ones who helped us."

I arrived pretty late for check-in (45 minutes prior to departure) and my agent seemed at first apprehensive in wanting to assist me due to my late arrival. However, with some convincing, she came around and called the gate. I would have rated ground service higher if I felt her first approach was to help me by checking albeit seeming difficult instead of the no reception I got. The inflight experience was better than my ground one. There were many hours of inflight entertainment to watch and free Wi-Fi connectivity was available for basic messaging on apps like WhatsApp, which is an appreciated amenity. Yummy Kind bars and Cheez It crackers were passed out alongside a choice of beverage, although a meal like a sandwich would be preferred anytime. The crew were your quintessential American flight attendant, not the most polished, but friendly, chatty and approachable which I appreciate because it feels like home. Insofar as seat comfort, it was fine less the seat pouch in front of me that was stretched out, eating into my leg space. As my preferred US carrier, I will keep giving my business to Delta when the price is right."

They were late with their flight from Miami to New York Kennedy Airport and and I missed my flight with Air France.

(already 2 days of vacation down the drain). Just when I thought it couldn't get any worst, when trying to fly back home the plane was once again delayed. The reason? They need 5 flight attendants to fly. They only had 4 currently because  the 5th person is stuck in traffic. When the 5th flight attendant showed up ... all 5 of them had lunch at another gate so they won't be seen. Unbelievable know they caused the delay.

Next we air in the air and the captain comes on speaker stating that there’s bad weather in DC, and AC wants us to stay in the air for one extra hour but we don’t have enough fuel to do that.

922,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sarasota to New York,July 2021,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Recently this Thursday, I had the worst experience I have ever encountered on a flight. My family and I had important plans to fly into New York, LGA. However, during our flight, about a half an hour away from LGA the captain of the plane informed us we will be having a delay and they will be stopping the plane in Atlanta. We were upset but understood this is due to weather conditions, and they let us know it would probably be a 1-2 hour delay and to stay close to the terminal when we get off the airplane. When we got off, we were then informed that our flight was actually going to be delayed until 8am in the morning! Shocked, we proceeded to find a help desk to see what we were going to do. As we were walking, we noticed another flight that was boarding for the same place we were supposed to go to, LGA! We were so confused on how they were able to go but we were not? We stood in a very long line with only 2 employees at the counter, and we received a hotel voucher for the Radisson which gave us a $40 discount, we still had to pay $108 for the hotel room which was shocking to us! We were also told that we would use the same tickets we had tomorrow morning at the Atlanta Airport. When we asked an Atlanta Airport employee where the shuttle was for the hotel, he looked at us completely clueless and like he was under hard influence of something, so we kept walking and hoped we would eventually find the shuttle ourselves! We were also told the flight would be departing at 8am, so we had to wake up early in the morning and catch the 5.30am shuttle to Atlanta Airport. This is really when the true nightmare began, as we asked an employee where we should go with our tickets, and she told us since we already had the tickets from our delayed flight we could hop in line for the regular security route. So, after waiting 15-20 minutes in line we went up to the employee who scans the boarding passes and was told “We cannot take these passes you need new ones, leave out that exit door” and we were rudely told to leave as the employee got frustrated with us as we were trying to explain our situation. We then got in line for Special Services, which the security employee directed us too by pointing. It was 5.30am and there was no employees there to even help us yet because they were in a briefing, so we were told by another employee they won’t be available until 6am! Astonished, we got in another line for Special Services and waited about 25 more minutes. We were then greeted by a man all the way at the right side corner, and we attempted to explain our situation with him. He got very rude with us and told us our flight was now taking off at 6.30am and that he would not give us new boarding passes and insisted that we could use the same ones we had even after getting kicked out of security! My father tried to explain further to him, and he replied “Would you rather just sit here and argue with me and miss you flight?” I was astonished by this type of treatment, I truly felt like I was highly disrespected after spending over 1000 dollars this month on flights with Delta! He refused to even look at our boarding passes. We then headed over back by security and began trying to explain our situation to another lady who told us we needed new boarding tickets as well. However, another worker heard us in distress and walked over to us. She was a customer relations worker, I had forgotten to get her name however she was the nicest most helpful woman."

My layover was only 1 hr 15 min, and I was hurrying to the gate C10 of MSP, but I saw a back of a gate worker leaving to close it and while I was approaching she never double checked. I never heard my name being announced while walking to the gate, I hurried but timing was very bad. She closed the gate and I missed the flight. She misled me that I’d take another one same evening, but I ended up staying in a hotel overnight. I don’t know if I get back the next day. Delta airlines is not great, I will try avoiding it in future. I regret I have a membership with DeltaSky, they still treat you like a luggage. They knew the flight got delayed due to storm and never waited just a couple of minutes. Terrible experience!"

Last time I'm flying with Delta, and I didn't even step in the plane yet. The line at check-in was 1.5hr long with a completely disorganized and bossy employee giving us life lessons repeatedly on arriving late if we didn't show up 3 hours before taking off. We arrived 2hrs ahead, which is plenty, and I don't feel like being infantilized by people failing miserably at their jobs. All of this to be left standing an additional 2hrs in the hall with barely enough seats for a quarter of the passengers. I felt really badly for the families and the seniors. The communication on the multiple delays was poor. We will be taking off at least one hour late. It happens but simply made the whole circus we endured for the previous 4hrs all the more pointless."

My seat partner was not wearing her mask the entire flight, it was down under her chin, flight attendants made no effort to enforce the mask policy. I was ignored by flight attendants on my flight, when trying to get their attention. However they did respond to others around us, and enforced the mask policy to people directly in front of and behind my row. When I called to file a complaint I was told that it was not a concern to my health. This person was wearing her mask in the airport gate waiting area. I get makes are uncomfortable. Sun Country Airlines did a much better job on their flights, I will be flying with them in the future. I will not fly with Delta any longer. "

I strongly believe I am being charged too many  miles for a low quality first class. I don’t mind going back home to LA with Coach so I can get my miles back.

The heralded suites are nothing spectacular and the joke “ no hot meals due to Covid” story is ok’d, outdated, and a lie.There is a ton of interaction with the crew. Serving the horrible snack boxes, and drinks along with water and coffee is perhaps more contact than a hot meal service would involve. OK, that point is made. The offerings suck and are inexcusable. Meanwhile, the seat is spacious, my door was broken, so no “privacy” The shoulder seat belt is incredibly uncomfortable and the opposite of what it should be. What has happened to Delta.

930,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to San Diego,June 2021,,,,,,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  This is a customer service review. I bought a ticket and made a mistake on one of my flights because I paid for an economy ticket customer service would do nothing to help me rebook my ticket. They would not even give me an e credit towards the rebooking of my flight. They said because it was more than 24 hours after booking I couldn't make the change. I tried to make the change in the allotted time but their website wouldn't let me. When I tried calling in the had a 7 hour hold time. I tried several times in the following days always receiving a hold time of over 2 hours. I tried to do their chat on the website but couldn't get through to anyone. Delta made it nearly impossible to make any changes to my ticket and when I finally get through they say there is nothing they can do even though I want to immediately rebook. It would cost them nothing to give me an e credit towards booking another flight. I have already paid and am willing to pay the difference and to even upgrade my ticket, but neither option was given to me. I am very upset about their policies to screw people up who are trying to save money."

My mask had slipped too slightly below my nose as I was putting my bag below the seat in front of me. A steward asked me to raise my mask, which I did. As he stepped past my row he snickered and sarcastically said ""nice attitude"". When I questioned what he said he turned back to me and proceeded to belittle and talk down to me. He embarrassed me in front of the other passengers! I told him I did a I was told with no attitude yet he continued his rant. This behavior is unacceptable. I will never fly this airline again!"

My baggage was soaked. They then gave me seat that didn't exist on another airline, didn't pass along any of the info about my special needs daughter or even seat us together. Honestly there's plenty more to complain about with this airline but no one will read all this and Delta surly won't care enough to make a single change. This is an absolute joke of a airline.

It was supposed to be a simple day of travel and Delta turned it into a full day of misery. I wish that there were actual staff working with Delta to make a better customer experience, but they do not have that even to a fraction, unless you count a scripted response from every employee to keep sending you on a run around trying to get an answer to when you will get to the place you paid to go. I just cannot believe how awful air travel has become. The ground staff and customer service line was a total joke, and just infuriating to try talking to, that is if you get a chance to before they just leave the desk with a line of people."

I waited 40 minutes before I realised no one was going to answer. A third world country would have better service. I flew on the DL952 from DFW to LAX on June 29th 2021. First there was no fast track security for first class passengers which is off putting when you have a significantly more expensive ticket. The lunch box given was pitiful and sad and quite frankly betrayed laziness. We are already past that curve of covid where you can get away with not offering service using that excuse. It is blatantly an act of being cheap on the part of the airline. The service was awful. The young gentleman that served us was probably the least friendly flight attendant I have ever encountered especially given he is serving first class passengers which makes it worse. Unsmiling, unfriendly, looked bored and uninterested in his job. There was a young lady who also came and checked the cabin during take off and landing equally unfriendly and sporting 2 inch white nails which was shocking. This would have been unheard of in a European airline where grooming standards are closer to what they should be, but I guess this is Delta so anything goes, including gross nails. Overall I am not impressed and we fly Delta a lot due to the fact that my partner has the highest status with Delta. Something I'd like to encourage him to shift to another airline that is more concerned with passenger experience and customer service standards."

942,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Rome,June 2021,,,,,,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Terrible, terrible service. Will not fly Delta aver again. I booked a R/T flight from Washington Dulles to Rome, Italy. My children were going 10 days ahead of me and my son's friend's Dad was trying to book a flight that married up to mine so he could travel with me to join us on vacation. My son's friend's Dad called to ask of I knew that my flights had been cancelled. ""No"" was my reply as this was in no way ever communicated to me. We then checked on the flights of my children and learned that their flights had also been cancelled with no notice. Wow ... not even an e-mail with an update. I called numerous tome with lengthy waits. One morning, I waited 2 hours and 10 minutes, but got through to customer service. I cancelled our flights and the woman on the line asked us to hold while she went to check on the refund. She came back and, before providing us an answer, asked us to call back! Really! Well, I did call back and was put into a queue that stated that I would receive a call in the next 2 hours. Six hours later, I did receive that call. The gentlemen was quite helpful. The tickets had been cancelled and fully refunded...thought no confirmation e-mail evert sent. This little mishap of an experience is now over. I would like to point out, though, that we had this exact same experience last summer with similar flights between Washington Dulles and Rome Fiumincino. These flights were Alitalia flights in both instances. After reading this review, should you still choose to book with Delta, I would strongly recommend you check your flight status on occasion prior to your trip so you do not find yourself standing at the airport on the day you think your are flying only to find your flight has been cancelled. I will no have to concern myself with this as I will never again fly Delta Airlines. The only thing I will do is continue to share my story with any who ask about my experience with Delta."

From the start of this trip it’s been a nightmare getting help. First our flight was delayed out of Portland for over 3 hrs which made us miss our International flight/connection in Minneapolis. We ended up losing a day and a half of our trip to Iceland. Then while in Iceland My mother was in a really bad accident and was in the ICU. I need to speak with someone to change my flight to come home early. I had to wait for over 3 hrs on the phone to get help. My husband stayed in Iceland to finish out the trip. My mother has taken a decline and now won’t pull through so my husband is trying to get home to be here before she passes and can not get through to anyone to help. It’s a 9 hour hold. Delta talks about how much they care and how important customer service is but there is zero customer service!! I am so disappointed in this airline.

The staff I have encountered is generally rude and arrogant. The customer and their needs are never a priority. I watched as one gate attendant got in a screaming match with a passenger who didn’t check her bag at gate and refused to believe the passenger when she said she didn’t hear her ask her to check it (despite the employee wearing a mask which makes it difficult for anyone to communicate). It then turned out there was plenty of bin space and no bags needed to be checked. They are rude and in your face monitoring mask compliance. Understandably it’s a difficult situation, but other airlines still manage to treat passengers with respect when asking for compliance."

The pilot kept the passengers informed as he was informed. Although it was uncomfortable waiting on the tarmac but he calmed us by staying calm and keeping up informed. My hat goes off to him."
948,1,,Business,Premium Economy,Chicago to Ft Lauderdale via Atlanta,June 2021,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Where do I start. Arrived 1.5 hrs ahead of my flight and paid the fee to ensure I would not lose my flight or be bumped. Followed all standard protocols and abided by all rules. Remind you my flight was booked to leave early A.M. so arrival in Chicago would leave me enough time to get a full day's work in and return to Florida mid-day. Arrived at Fll at 4am. Our flight was at 5:30 am. with a connection in Atlanta. Plane broke on the runway. Then the plane needed fuel, then the plane broke again. Anyways my flight was changed 2 times before we arrived in Atlanta and when we arrived at 8:54 our connection had just left at 9am. Missed that one too. Then they put me on the 11am flight. Last 2 seats but we made it. Arrived in Chicago 4 hours late. And then had to set there until 4pm because they forgot our tools for the job in Atlanta. We missed the appointment to work on the vessel and all reservations were missed. Our return flight was at 10am by luck we had a chance to have a conversation with the yacht owner who was very disappointed and asked if we could at least come come and look at the vessel since we had made the trip up there. The only thing Delta did correct was we schedule our flight for 6:30pm Saturday. Which gave us the time to see the customer. When we made it to boarding and was filing on to the aircraft the flight attendant had an issue with another passenger that we weren't even with who was drinking or drunk not sure as I was not with him. But she advised us to get off the plane. Then she proceeded to tell the captain and redcoat she felt endangered.  To end the story that left me sleeping on the floor until at the airport until this morning at 7:30am. I'm writing my review on the plane waiting to take off and I'm livid! This is the absolute worst experience I have ever had flying in 30 years. No beverages, rude people, old planes, and allowing some inexperienced individuals with no one to answer to running the show.

The flights were very delayed on Saturday night so I know they worked very late but returned the next morning with smiles on their faces. They were the last people we saw before we left to go to the hotel and the first ones we saw the next morning. Our new seat assignments allowed me and my 2 kids to sit together.

This flight was done in preparation for our father-in-law's funeral it's bad enough to deal with a death in the family and then to be treated like this  when you pay well over $1,000 just for a weekend of flight.

She told me they would serve nuts regardless of my life threatening allergy.  I can’t believe how I was treated after having such a good experience the first time.  I was told by the boss of the attendants on the plane that he was obligated to serve nuts if a passenger requested it. I understand that some people may bring their own snacks, but not serving nuts shows that you care about my safety and are reducing my risk of a life threatening reaction by almost 100%. Once the captain heard my story, he had no issues switching the snacks to just pretzels and cliff bars. He even walked through the plane to tell everyone nuts would not be served. Then the attendants listened to him, after making me feel less than human for having an allergy and told that people’s need to snack on nuts was more important than my life. "

I travel first or business class for all flights over three hours. I will not use Delta again. On trip back I paid extra for a shorter flight with minimal stops. Paid extra to have my boys sit together and Delta chanted all flights removing pre paid seats and separated our boys. The new flight added many hours to our journey. Not a pleasant experience. I had a choice between Delta and American for the trip and even though Delta was more booked it for more direct flight. So disappointed."
955,3,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Maui via Salt Lake City,June 2021,3,1,1,4,4,4,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  We were a party of 4 flying from Denver, CO to Maui, HI. We had booked this trip almost 6 months prior, and I had a choice of seats, and picked out the ones I wanted. However this flight was switched a few months back, and although they specified to check the schedule change, which I did, and there was just a few minutes difference in time. I did not think that I would have to check my seats, as I assumed they would transfer with the flight. They did not! I found this out the day before our flight, and I scrambled to find adjoining seating for the 4 of us, and was successful in locating seating for us, it was in the middle and not window seats like I had originally chosen. I called Delta hoping that I would be able to speak with an agent and get things changed. I was told by a recorded message that the wait time could be up to 3 hrs! which is ridiculous, however, I was determined to speak to someone to get changes made to our seating arrangement. 1 hr went by, and then 2! Still no answer. After waiting until 3 hrs and 3 minutes, I decided i had had enough, and took a screen shot to prove to Delta that I had tried to make changes to my seating arrangements to no avail!. On to Baggage Check. Check-In went reasonably well, and the Baggage Check-In Process went fairly quickly. This was the first time we had flown Delta in a long time. We usually travel using Southwest, and are used to their Baggage Check-In and Boarding Process. Needless to say, I was surprised at the baggage fees we were charged. On Southwest your baggage is free! Not the case with Delta. It cost $30 for the 1st checked bag and $40 for a second. For the 4 of us we had 6 bags, and it cost me $200! I should have done more checking on this prior to purchasing tickets. The only reason for flying Delta in the first place was that they fly larger jets to Hawaii than Southwest, and so we thought we'd be more comfortable, which we later found out not to be the case. Next came the boarding process, and after waiting for everyone else to board, finally it was our turn to go and find our seats that I was forced to endure. Our connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake City was delayed due to an air conditioning issue? In any case it caused enough of a delay that when we landed in Salt Lake City, we were told that they were doing a final boarding call for our flight to Maui. We ran with our carry on luggage down the concourse for about a quarter mile or so, and they were just closing the door on the jetway and informed us that we had just barely made it. We told them that there were a couple of others from our flight also on their way, but they did not seem concerned, and closed the jetway door behind us. Flight to Hawaii was pretty uneventful, but while our beverage requests were taken care of, it was evident that the flight attendants were not happy with their jobs. It seemed like everything that we asked of them was a burden. The snacks are another thing. No variety at all. We were offered the same snacks over and over on each of the 4 legs of our trip. Almonds and Biscoff cookies.  We will be flying Southwest next time. About the only annoying thing about that airline is that you need to be prompt in your check-in 24 hrs in advance in order to get an A or B pass."

We had a flight booked with Delta from ATL airport on Father’s Day leaving at 12:15 PM going to JFK Airport . We arrived at the airport three hours early as we try to prepare flying with small children. First we were never told that while traveling with an infant on lap we will be required to formally check in and will not be able to use the kiosk. The lines of formally check in took us about an hour and a half with two young children in a double stroller. We kept telling them was there another way for us to check in or asking for help as both children were not able to tolerate the wait. We were told we had to wait in that line however they were pulling off people with pets to make sure they were checked in on time for their flight. An hour and a half later we finally reached the check-in, we checked in went through security and arrived at the gate at 12:03 PM where there was a whole debacle of people Up in arms as they were flying standby. I tried to make my way up to the counter to explain we had tickets and we’re on this plane. The girl told me we were too late and our tickets were given away and to go to see customer service. There I am traveling with a one-year-old and a three-year-old and our bags trying to get on my flight that they gave our tickets away as we were not there 15 minutes early. However the plane was still there still boarding but they gave our tickets away. We headed to customer service for Delta by the time we got a supervisor involved the plane had already left. Once the supervisor realized this was a mistake made and we should’ve been able to board our scheduled flight he put us on the next flight which was hours later. Now sitting in an airport for 5 to 6 hours with two babies was a horrible experience. But this is not the worst of it we finally land at JFK airport about 6:45 PM with our two children to find our luggage was not there. Delta at JFK told us he never left Atlanta and he said it up to be shipped to our residence home for the following day. The following day came and our luggage with never sent I called five different times and heard five different stories first I heard it was in Atlanta then I heard it was in JFK then I heard it came in on the first flight that we were scheduled to be on it don’t know what happened to it then I heard that it came in on the second flight that we were on they don’t know what happened to it and then I was hung up on. Finally being fed up I demanded a callback from a supervisor as in this luggage was medical equipment for my infant daughter. My daughter was born with bilateral hip dislocation and was it a body cast the first half of her life no she currently uses a hip brace to prevent her hips from falling out of place. She is supposed to wear this every night at bedtime this brace cost a few thousand dollars. After being so rudely treated and lied to I had to let the Delta representative know that any harm done to my child’s progress with her hips Delta would be accountable for and I will make sure of it then all the sudden a supervisor called me back. My bag was suddenly found she said it’s been at JFK the whole time but they did not want to ship it"

After trying three different numbers I finally found help. Then they had no record of my wife's and my tickets when we arrived at the airport, so they had to reroute us. Then they had no record of my ticket on the way back home although it worked out alright. Worst of all, we discovered that my wife's brand-new never-before-used cloth bag looked like they had literally dragged it through the mud! But at least they agreed to pay for it, and the people who worked with us were helpful."

By the time they let me go the plane had already departed and they wanted me to pay $416.00 for another ticket. Also the young lady working the gate counter needs a whole lot of training. She was so nasty rude and disrespectful. I wouldn’t recommend Delta Worst airline ever. I won’t ever book through them again. Out of all my years of flying this is the worst experience I’ve ever had.

Flight that was delayed until after midnight this morning was cancelled, and everyone put up at a hotel after a two hour wait in line. At the hotel, no one from Delta had made arrangements. Waited in line there until 3:30Am. Back to the airport by shuttle bus at 8:00AM, but no staff available for checkin. More waiting in line. After being promised expedited check-in and immigration processing, stood for twenty minutes at the desk waiting for new reservations (N.B. Delta staff should look up the definition of ""expedited."" ) It seems that no one had remembered to transfer the reservation from the cancelled flight to the new one, as had been promised. No expedited customs and immigration. Now at the gate at 11:50 AM waiting to board a flight that was supposed to leave at 11:30 AM. What is wrong with this airline? Is it run by incompetents or by malicious demons bent on torturing passengers? The sauce on the pudding will be watching the sappy video on the plane featuring the CEO telling me how much he cares.

Upon arrival to Syracuse, I immediately went to the baggage department to file a claim. The surly Delta employee made sure to constantly mention during our conversation that what happened was considered ""acceptable damage that will not be covered"". The way he chose to speak to me was certainly an attempt to provoke a response or argument from me. After I insisted that he file a claim and that I was not willing to leave the airport since I know that a claim may not be honored if one leaves, the rude employee handed me the claim form and told me the next step is for me to wait to be contacted. He kept the bag sticker tag. Fast forward over a month of not hearing anything, I called only to find out that I was supposed to fill out another claim form online using the code the agent in Syracuse gave me. The bag tag sticker he kept is also needed to fill out this online form. That means my claim is no longer able to progress any further. A $120 bag damaged."

I was freezing and asked a flight attendant if they have blankets, they didn’t have any. Since the screen wasn’t working, I wanted to use my iPad with gogoinflight but screen was saying entertainment temporarily unavailable. I can give only one star to this airline.

I do not particularly appreciate how Delta forced their clients to make their reservations online because the phone wait time is more than 6 hrs. When you finally add all the parties that will be on the flight, you are supposed to call in for individuals under the age of 2 to go free. Bear in mind that the long wait time. I wasted $206 on a ticket that was supposed to be free because my son is under the age of 2. The Delta representative informed me that error should have been corrected before I flew, even though I told them I tried fixing this error in the airport. Sorry Delta, your customer service quality is poor, especially when the flight is not cheap. The flight's television malfunctioned on our way back to Florida and the food that was provided to us was cheap. I had way better service in United Airlines. I guess I will think 3x before I fly with Delta again."

Delta put me on a five hour wait, no one ever answered the phone, then I called back the following day they said they had a 20 hour wait to talk to customer service. After being on hold for 3 hours, I hung up and was never helped. Long story short I ended buying another return flight through Southwest and I never plann on giving Delta my business."

Called Delta and was told to go to desk where supervisor would provide discounted hotel voucher since next Flight was 8am the next day. Delta supervisor scared me 2mins then told me he was not sure why I was told that because they can't offer me a voucher for weather delays. I call back Delta as 8am flight will not work for due to job requirements and was presented with a $300 fee to change the flight to a later time within the same day (within 24hr window). So I have to stay in JFK overnight and miss work so that Delta incurs no additional cost by adjusting a flight.

The first half of the flight was even warmer than the flight down. The second half was bearable. I was wearing a summer weight blouse and skirt and did not need another layer. This is a big change since before covid. It used to be that when you opened the air vent, you felt air blowing on you. I was not alone in my perception."

Took a red eye flight home and the two flight attendants were the most loud, unprofessional, chatty staff I’ve ever experienced. They didn’t have any concerns for the passengers and talked about their personals lives as if they were on their first date with each other. I know their life story, they were not quiet, they were just so involved with the friendship they connected with each other and no concern for the people around them. Sadly the woman has a marriage ring on but they were giggling and laughing like they would be together forever. I’ve never seen anything like it or that rude. That can’t possibly be protocol I had headphones in and that did not help. I paid for comfort seats and wasted my money. Terrible trip.

980,1,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Charleston to Atlanta,May 2021,2,3,,,2,,2,0,Not Verified ,"  I read the other reviews on Delta and I guess these people think the airlines really care about bad reviews. It’s the same bad reviews that have been going on for years with no changes. My flight was delayed for 3 hours because I guess Delta didn’t think it would be busy on Memorial Day weekend at the near end of a pandemic and no one has gone anywhere for over a year. Poor unqualified managers are in charge of the new American business models, in which customer service is the least of their concern. It’s in almost every business now, with the exception of a few who are very successful. It reminds me of another airline years ago who had a sign at their check in counter which stated “ just because you have a ticket does not guarantee you will be on this flight”."
981,3,,Couple Leisure,First Class,Portland to Key West via LaGuardia,May 2021,4,2,1,,1,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  May 21st – May 25th 2021, we flew to EYW from PWM with LGA as a stopover. We’d flown to Key West in FLA in October 2020 First Class and Tampa in January Comfort Plus, and loved both trips. What we didn’t realize is that the planes we’d be flying on this time around were smaller. 2 seats on one side, 1 on the other. There was no separation, which eliminated the “exclusive” feel we’d enjoyed with our first trip. Additionally, there were no TV screens. On the December flight, we were able to watch entire feature films. Additionally, each of the four legs of the trip were different in terms of food or drink service. Leg 1 - PWM to LGA we were offered snack boxes in addition to water, drinks, etc. On the shorter LGA to EYW, we were not offered the boxes. On the return trip, no snack boxes were even offered. Added to the substantially downgraded “first class” experience due to the smaller aircraft, this all contributes to an overall sloppy and inconsistent feel, that is to say, “You never know what you’re going to get until you get on board”. On the leg back, we were looking forward to a couple of the new margaritas in the can. They were amazing, having discovered them on the way down. But, they only packed 2 cans for the whole trip for the plane, the attendant says this happens a lot. We’ve had similar experiences where we weren’t able to get water because you’d run out of the little 8 oz bottles. That’s just unacceptable. (As a side note, an 8 oz bottle of water on a 2-3 hour flight offers little in the way of meaningful hydration. I generally ask for two for each of us. Perhaps a more practical size would be more appropriate?) At the Key West airport on the leg back to LGA, we were the last ones to board. Why? Because the young attendant did not call first class. When we asked about it, she said, “well I called Diamond, that’s the same thing.” Well, no, it’s not. This same attendant was very unhelpful when we asked her about boarding passes. On our last trip to KW we had to print boarding passes vs. using our mobile ones. She said she didn’t really know, they prefer printed but that we should be able to use the mobile, well, can we use them or not? Finally, I’m hard of hearing. I understand that there’s not a lot that can be done because of the mask wearing mandates, but you’ve really got to teach your employees how to make clear announcements. How to annunciate properly, speak reasonably slowly and loudly enough. I’ve never felt so discriminated in my life, having to ask people around me if you’d said anything important. (Most of them didn’t hear the announcements either). On the first leg from PWM to LGA there was one young lady who was wonderful. Every other attendant gave us the impression that we were a bother. So all in all, we paid for a first class experience, and did not receive it on several fronts. We found little similarity between our December & January first class trips and this one. We’re seriously disappointed, and will be sure to ascertain what type of plane we’ll be flying on and get clear on boarding and offerings. Additionally, as a direct result of our disappointment, we plan to book our next first class trip with either AA or United. Our $800+ price gave us less service and experience than a $200 SW flight."

I've always flown Southwest but we had credits that we had to use because of the pandemic and they said we had to use them within a year. It took me 3 weeks to change my flight because there was an 8, 10 and 12 hours wait times on the telephone phone. Also, on the website, it says luggage fees may apply and when we get to the check-in area they tell us $90 for luggage fees, well they should have just said from the beginning luggage wasn't free. For the price, I paid for luggage, long wait times on the phone, and the poor customer service I could have flown Southwest with free luggage and cheaper fees, and good customer service. You think them knowing their wait times on the telephone is horrible, and all the bad reviews people have been leaving they would at least throw in the luggage for all the headache. Well, Delta Air Lines you have lost me as a customer and I fly frequently."
984,1,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Billings to Cancun,May 2021,1,1,,,1,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  I have yet to actually take my flight. But the experience leading up to it is just insanely ridiculous. My husband and I are going to Mexico for our anniversary. Using vouchers as our original trip was last year. I re-booked in February this year and from that point forward, it has been one disaster after another. They 'canceled' our flights and re-booked for much longer flight times. Got them switched to something more manageable. Then, they 'changed' our flights to extended layovers again. Paid extra for them to change the flights back to the original flights booked, just to have them tell me the departure flight was 'canceled' and they re-booked us for the same flying times, just an entire 24 hours later. Because losing 24 hrs of your vacation means nothing to them. When I called Delta again (and I am telling you, I have wasted over 15 hrs on hold with all of my phone calls to Delta), the customer service lady said that the flight was not canceled. It was just overbooked. I asked to speak with a manager/supervisor and was told there was none available at that time and then I couldn't get a time for when one would be available. Currently on hold for an hour to try and switch our return flight for 24 hrs later so I can still get my full 7 days of vacation in. But seriously, Delta. You have done me wrong this time and it is unappreciated and I will never fly with you again. You are not even trying to help. You're just giving my seats away for new paying customers and think that I don't care. Majorly disappointed."

986,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Seoul,May 2021,,,,,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I had a horrible interaction today with a Delta check-in employee and had to reschedule my international flight because delta's COVID testing policy differs from South Korea's actual government policy/that of every other airline. I wanted to file a complaint and the wait time to reach customer service is 6 hours? I used to hold Delta to a quality a step above other airlines but they are seriously slacking these days! For those interested, I was held at check-in and missed my flight even though I arrived 2 hours early because the check-in person didn't realize I was a Korean citizen and not a foreign traveler. As an aside, Delta's policy for flights to South Korea is ridiculous and doesn't follow the actual government guidelines. Their policy is COVID test results have to be within 72 hours of the departure flight so a test at 8AM on 5/21 would not count for a flight at 10AM on 5/24 even if it is the same 3 days. The Korean government policy is that the 72 hours resets at 12AM every day so it shouldn't matter what the hour of day it is. From the Korean government website: ""The test needs to be issued no more than 72 hours before the departure date. *For example, for travelers whose flight departed on May 10, 2021 at 10:00 a.m., documents issued on or after May 7, 2021 (past 0:00) will be accepted."" That is how every other airline like Korean Airline honors the testing. I will be flying Korean air from now on."

988,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Lima,May 2021,2,1,3,3,1,2,1,0,Not Verified ,"  I'm so disappointed in the terrible customer care I received on my recent delta flight. First, on the Delta email confirmation after purchasing my child's ticket, it clearly stated that we got a carry on AND checked bag (50lbs/23kil) Free for them. When trying to check in, the gate attendant first said we got NO checked bag for the child's ticket & after talking about it a while, they said, Oh actually you do get a checked bag, but it has totally different dimensions than a normal checked bag, and it can only be 10lbs. All of this info, even though our email confirmation did not only NOT say that, but said that we should get a 50lb bag for FREE. On a call after the fact while filing a complaint about the issues with the flight and trying to explain my experience as a customer, the representative spent the whole time contracting me and his/herself. And even though they (and all the other Delta people I had talked to in my experience checking in and boarding - everyone contracted themselves regularly) didn't know all the info, they told me I should have known because somehow the information was clear ... to everyone... and it was my fault for not knowing the rules? So people working for Delta couldn't figure it out every time I talked to someone after arriving to the airport, but it was definitely the customer's fault for not knowing? Bad customer experience on all levels. Great job, Delta. Tell us one thing in your direct communication about the flight and then hide the info that contracts that info, and then tell the customer they are the problem...?! Really? I'll be going with a different airline next time."
989,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Minneapolis,May 2021,1,2,,,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Our flight was grounded due to a maintenance issue which was understandable. However, after being deplaned with minimal explanation, the 1pm flight was rescheduled for 4pm. A few minutes later it was announced that the flight was rescheduled yet again and would be departing at 630pm. When several passengers inquired about the reason for a 5.5 hour delay, the gate agents wouldn’t disclose any information. How is it possible that an airline the size of Delta has absolutely zero backup plan in place? It is unacceptable that an alternative aircraft could not be arranged in less than 5.5 hours. Delta endlessly boasts of its excellent service and on-time arrivals but they certainly don’t deliver. After two similar past experiences I was compelled to leave a review. I will not be flying Delta again."
990,2,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Detroit,April 2021,2,3,,4,3,,3,0,Not Verified ,  It is impossible to get anyone from Delta on the telephone! Their ticketing procedure has become very confusing with hidden / additional fees for seats in the main cabin. The last time I flew there three additional fees tacked on to the basic ticket price. I tried calling Delta about these changes to my credit card and spent over 3 hours trying to talk to someone. I have flown on Delta for many years. But my last two trips (one in March 2021 and one in April 2021) and my upcoming trip (May 2021) have me wondering if I should find a different airline. Air travel has become very expensive and being unable to speak to someone when I need to is extremely frustrating.

I get it, who needs any help booking a flight? but when your flight gets delayed and then an hour later is on time you can find yourself in a tough situation. This situation is not the first time its happened but the communication has never improved, we were notified at 3pm that our 6.40 flight was delayed till 8.30, but being 1.5 hours from the airport we were in the cab, so we went back to the hotel. 30 minutes later we received a text that our flight was on time, so now we are cutting close to get back to the airport. 5 hour hold time to call someone. At the airport we were told flight is delayed till 10 but we needed to be there at the original time to get thru customs, ok but how about putting that in the text. When they finally cancelled the flight they told us the original flight would leave at 10.15 but stop in Atlanta. Atlanta was experiencing tornados, so being stuck in Atlanta didn't seem like a good option, so we rebooked at the same time the next day, only to find out an hour later that the 10:15 flight was non-stop to JFK. Again we tried to call, I'm still on hold its been 8 days. I spent years traveling discount airlines before I could appreciate the value of quality over price, but the stress of Delta's customer service is forcing me to look at other airlines."

On my flight to Alabama I noticed the flight attendants were giving out free alcohol to the few people who asked for it, and they just said to leave them a good review, I didn't ask for any at the time because I wasn't prepared to pay for airplane vodka and I wasn't sure, but on my return flight I figured I'd go for it because I was feeling anxious and if it was free, why not? But I asked, and the lady came back, handed me the bottle, and asked for a credit card. I was taken aback, and had to reach down under the seat where my purse was, and the stupid cart was in the way so I bumped my head, the lady was very rude and uncaring, and it was just a terrible experience because the attendants were so nice on my flight down here but they were just so rude on my flight back home. Seriously doubting I'll ever fly Delta again."

Although the aircraft was the same type, this flight was much better. Covid has created a lack of quality control and it is no ones fault. I will say that although the previous crew was fine, this group is a little sunnier and more interactive. Also the food and amenity kit are far superior out of Minneapolis. The seat is still not fantastic but it is fine and I would choose this over a regular first class flight."

Second time she said this is the second time I’ve had to tell you to pull up your mask she could’ve done it without embarrassing him by now she must’ve had some kind of kind way to remind passengers.

They have the worst customer service I have ever seen on a flight. I was flying with my 3 kids, ages 3, 5 and 10. We all had face masks on, however with talking to toddlers and chewing food the mask would fall below our noses. The attendant spoke to me about my 5 year olds mask, and we fixed it. Shortly later I received a “final warning” and was told a red coat would remove me from the flight. They also made this announcement to the entire flight threatening to be removed like criminals. A group of 6 young men were sitting behind us, and before even leaving the gate the male attendant told them they would be removed if they gave him any problems. They were doing nothing wrong. Those boys also told the “red coat” that the attendant never spoke to me aside from the one time about my 5 year old. The attitudes over masks slipping down is ridiculous. Even if I were spoken to, they acted like I threw a fit and refused to wear a mask completely when I in fact had the mask on the entire time. The attendant also rammed the snack cart into a woman’s leg/arm rest several times to push past. I have flown Jetblue since Covid and had no problems, I had no problems going from Boston to Florida on Delta. This crew was just awful. The “red coat” they made out to be an evil person ready to throw me in prison, was very nice and understanding even when the attendant butted into our conversation after the boys behind me said I wasn’t spoken to. She said “we also spoke to the boys multiple times too”. I didn’t see her talk to them at all about their mask falling under their noses."

There was a female Delta assistant sitting at the gate and answering questions for customers. Her attitude was one like the customers were bothering her and she didn’t want to put much effort into helping them or speaking up. She appeared annoyed with me and two customers before me. I then observed her looking at her cell phone and not long after, she departed the area.

999,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Edinburgh to New York,March 2021,,,,,,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Bait and switch from Delta. Booked in March 2021 from Edinburgh to New York on a direct flight at 10.30am, taking about 7 hours. I live 20 minutes from the airport and I chose Delta because it was a direct flight. These are difficult to get from Scotland as BA does not route a single flight from Scotland to the USA. You have to go via Heathrow. First May email comes saying not only am I now leaving at 6.00am in the morning instead of 10.30 but from Edinburgh to Amsterdam and then Amsterdam to New York - 15.5 hours. Delta fly daily from Edinburgh to JFK and while I understand they might have cancelled some of them due to Covid I did not expect them to cancel every, single flight. Every, single, day. I was quite surprised because when I tried to book by seats quite few were already taken. So many people have been inconvenienced. I had booked on the premise that if Scotland was shafted yet again as the easy option, they would fly me from another airport, one within the UK. They fly from Heathrow on both Delta operated flights and code share with Virgin too. But they routed me backwards via Amsterdam. Nine hours after I left the house for my 20 minute trip to the airport, I would be back over UK airspace again, right back to where I started.  They would not put me any of the Heathrow flights because they would have to pay BA to fly me there from Edinburgh and they do not code share with them.  They would not give me my money back because I am not American. US law means they have to refund American citizens if they cancel flights with no comparable alternative but as they advised me, they can pretty much do what they want with others. No legal requirement to compensate me or route me even from the same country. I could rebook but they would keep my money until I did. For a year. Then they would keep it all.  So, I had to cancel and rebook from Heathrow and pay the cost of getting myself a return flight from Edinburgh to Heathrow. Apart from the totally inconvenient flight times and flight changes from direct to indirect flights and 2 set sets of immigration to queue up for, I had no wish to have to check if 2 countries still had their borders open to UK citizens until 22nd June. If you live in the EU then Book with European airline in these uncertain times. EU law would have ensured that not only would a full refund be forthcoming, but 600 euro would have to be paid in compensation. UK has kept this part of EU law. Shame on you Delta, shame on you."

Getting in and out was laborious. Once in, it was comfortable though. Due to Covid, service was greatly reduced although a hot meal (all on one tray) was served. Honestly the food was bad. It’s hard to understand blaming Covid restrictions for quality. Flight attendants were great but had a horrible product to offer. Breakfast was inedible and I wasn’t the only one inquiring as to what the mess was (they called it grits). We arrived on time and, of course safely but the offerings are not going to convince people to fly let alone buy a premium ticket. Disappointing."

I had never used Delta before but it was the only airline that didn't have a 6am return flight. I was traveling with my boyfriend and 3 yr old son. First, I booked the flight and car. All the funds were pending. When it actually charged my card, I noticed it was 1 plane ticket less. I thought maybe they changed something due to my son's age, cool. So I questioned whether he would be allowed a carryon or not. The website says its based on price. Seeing as to how I wasn't sure what happened with the ticket prices, I figured I'd call to find out. I spent 9 HOURS to ask this simple question. 5 hours on hold waiting for someone to answer before I gave up, and 4 hours trying to use the online chat. Finally, I got someone, gave them the ticket number (which I figured they would say something if they missed the charge), they said yes to the carry on. Then we get to the airport. We're carrying our bags, a carseat, a stroller and a child. We were rushed through everything as if we were an inconvenience (ok whatever). We get to the gate and wait. Then our flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue with the a/c. For 2+ hours. We missed our connecting flight in Atlanta. At this point I'm stressed, but think ""better safe than sorry, things happen"". Flight back: again, rushed through security. Get to the gate. Wait. Another delay. Mechanical issue with the a/c unit. What are the chances? Again, waiting hours to get on the plane and missing our connecting flight home. Here's the kicker, it was the last flight from Minneapolis to Milwaukee that day so we were not getting home. They searched for options and said we can maybe get you on tomorrow but all of tomorrow's flights are booked up so we'll put you on standby and hopefully you get something. They put us in a hotel in Minneapolis for the night. I had thrown away a bunch of stuff that I didn't think we needed anymore; toothbrushes, toothpaste, trial sizes of deodorant, all of the toiletries. So we had none of that. Ok now we go to the airport again to see if we can get on a plane. They luckily said yes, gave us tickets. We wait. They announce the flight was overbooked and offered $400 for someone to take a later flight. No one took it. Eventually they landed on $600 and someone gave in. $600? I got a $50 hotel room to wait an entire day. Moving on, we go to board and they gave each of us separate seats. I asked if there was a way my 3yr old could sit by either myself or my boyfriend and they said I could figure it out myself. Finally, an attendant on the plane helped me switch seats with another rider so my toddler didn't have to sit with a stranger. We got home and I was just relieved to have it all over with. Then I check my bank account 5 days later and Delta charged me another $438.40!"

This seat was not being used. It caused a minimum of 10 passengers to miss their international connections. Including myself and my significant other.. The longer we sat there the more people deplaned, the more they had to wait to remove their checked luggage. We lost an entire vacation package we prepared for a year in advance over this stupid seat issue. It was the only flight going out all day. My first international trip ruined by Delta.

I purchase three tickets on my credit card with my skymiles number. I tried to cancel one of the flights after being on hold for nearly 20 hours in a single week! Then end result was the Delta customer service supervisor saying that the ticket is non-refundable and non-transferable. I did not buy a basic economy ticket. They are treating me like I bought the cheapest ticket I could on Expedia. I’ve had better experiences with Spirit Airlines. What a terribly run corporation. There are too many travel options to treat customers this way.

First of all, they delayed my departure flight weeks before my trip. I was able to move to an earlier flight so that I can still be able to work in the morning. Second, Delta delayed my arrival flight right when I got myself to the airport by an hour. Then further kept delaying it to the point that I sat around in the airport of 5 hours waiting. Delta delayed enough resulting in me having to change to a new connecting flight. Flight DL2525 somehow still managed to arrive late compared to its new stated time. Nobody was surprised. Finally, this major delay resulted in me having about 20 mins to get to my connecting flight. I took the shuttle and run across the airport. The gate is open and people are in line. I think I’m in luck. I ask the attendant to allow me in she says “I’m sorry” and tells the attendant “close the gate”. I truly had the door slammed in my face. I still haven’t arrived to my location and who knows what hoops I’ll have to jump to get eventually home. Delta needs to get organized until then I will need pure luck to get home."

It was a full flight. Delta flight crew keeps announcing that they are implementing the federal mask mandate but during our flight, there were many people with masks down. The passenger seated next to me only put his mask on for only 30 minutes during the entire 2.5 hours flight. Other passengers around us also were not wearing masks during the flight. The Detroit based flight crew just kept passing by these non-masked passengers without telling them to put on their masks. They were just turning a blind eye on passengers who do not want to put on their masks. We felt very unsafe during the flight. Delta flight crew does not really care about health & safety of their customers especially during this time of pandemic."

When i landed on Detroit i was told my 2nd flight was already gone. So i was stuck there for 3 hours. Then they finally found me a flight from Detroit to Minnesota.

I assumed that the entire flight was ‘rescheduled’ and we had been transferred together, but no, they had randomly changed my flight but not hers, no reason why. Delta did finally get us on the same flight, but not in the same row as had been confirmed two months earlier, so we still didn’t get to spend time together. Customer service has basically said, “too bad, how sad”, we’ll give you a gift card and maybe the difference in seating upgrade and baggage fees, nothing confirmed. Does not make up for the time we had hoped to spend together. We see each other every couple years or so, so it was a big deal to spend time together, but that does not seem to matter to customer service. I’m not likely to fly Delta again, and certainly will not trust any so-called confirmations from them."

When we arrived in KBP they told us they cant find our electronic tickets and made us pay 250 EUR for registration and ticket processing which is outrageous considering our trip was paid for and final. On top of that they made us pay $440 EUR for our one checked luggage and 1 carry on item per person which is covered by our tickets we purchased. So as you would imagine not the best experience flying with Delta having paid for tickets and having to pay even more money especially because none of this stuff is actually valid.  Sadly we were not alone and there were many other outraged customers who were affected and I am sure it will reflect on them flying with Delta in the future.

The Flight was delayed for fog in NY, not a problem I wasn't in a rush to get to CLE but just needed to get there hopefully by 5pm and even later would have been ok. Delay after delay after delay after delay came and went. They called me up and said that the connecting flight was in jeopardy but that they might make up time in the air and I might be ok, but they offered me a alternative to go to Detroit and then to Cleveland on a later flight, said they would put me on it and I could decide before the boarding of the one that might be late into NY. I said ok, fine. 2 minutes later they said they couldn't get me that because someone took the seat they had for me and it was the last one. OK, I figure well, at least I get to New York and surely Delta will get me to Cleveland, both being large cities. So the original flight delays more and more and they they find me again and say...we know you have been here for a very long time Sir, but we can't get you to Cleveland today""? What an epic failure for a supposedly professional company, a large carrier, the kind someone might book with and book first class because they are known as a reliable company! Don't be fooled, they are none of that if they cannot get a passenger to a city like Cleveland Ohio on a day they ticket you for. Not a holiday, not a busy time of year, nope, just a bungling company with terrible service that can't deliver on their service. This day cost me two uber riders to and from my home, it cost me food all day while I waited and waited being promised time and time again the flight would be leaving, I think a total of 6 times before I was told to take a hike because I wasn't making my trip today, I was told I could book with another airline and that they were out at this point. I could get a refund for my unfulfilled ticket by Delta. Of course when I asked that would my having to rebook on another airline today at a hugely inflated last minute ticket, would they include that on my refund, they were not taking any responsibility for that. Just go away sir and have a nice day. The only thing that went well at all, was the refund person that answered the phone in a reasonable amount of time and was very nice while quickly refunding my card. So apparently they do well at refunds, likely due to lots of practice! I always thought Delta was one of the top dogs in the industry, I mean I would have not been surprised if they were a small company like Elite, Spirit or Frontier, but Delta? They can't fix a screw up delay to a city like Cleveland? So I had to go home and not make a trip to do business for a couple of days because I chose a company like Delta, because I chose to trust my flight need to Delta.

Whatever issues you have, go unaddressed because they have ensured you never get them addressed. I wanted to change my name on the ticket, so I went to their website as they indicated because you can't talk to a real person. I never heard from them to confirm they received my form. I called and was on hold twice for an hour (estimated wait time 3 hours). I wrote customer service and an automated response directed to the same website. They act like they are going to answer a text on their app but that's a computer responding and it doesn't understand anything related to a conversation and keeps directing you to their website. So now I'm at risk of not being able to fly internationally next week because no one is responding. I will never ever fly Delta after this."

First flight was pretty relative of the Delta experience: Nice staff, comfortable seat, social distancing (as I booked the 3 side on the 717), and overall good flight. The 717 does not have IFE screens but I brought my own entertainment and the flight was only about an hour so it did not really matter anyway. My second flight, unfortunately, wasn't quite the same. Delta, without any notice or email or compensation or anything, put someone in the middle seat between me and my mom. All 3 of us were confused as Delta has a policy to not do this, so we consulted the gate agent who was more than happy to re-seat her since there was a few no-shows. However, this should not have happened in the first place. Normally my experiences on Delta are 10/10 but unfortunately this was just not the same. Some flight attendants on the 2nd flight also seemed a bit cranky and not happy to be there, though some were very nice as well. Overall, indifferent experience, could've been improved with some notice about the middle seat situation.

Me and my soon to be wife were flying to Las Vegas to get married. It was a dinner flight and I expected to get some dinner. However because me and my wife were sitting up in the very front we were the last ones to get served. When it came time to order our food there was no food left. Another passenger gave up their food so I let my wife eat it. I've never felt so disrespected in my life. The flight attendant was actually rude to me for the fact I was mad. I spent over $1000 each ticket for one way because I was buying a car there in Vegas to drive back. They never apologized to me or shown any gratitude. I will never fly Delta again.

We were unable to choose seats when we booked online. I called and asked for a call back. They promised within 20 minutes. 1 and half hours later they would not allow us to make sure the 5 and 12 year olds could not sit with their mother. Argumentative and rude customer service!!!! We have to wait and hope we can get seats together 24 hours before their flight. Unacceptable.

But it became my primary during the pandemic. I was moving from OKC to Denver, so this was a one way flight. Although there were nonstop flights to Denver I could've taken out of OKC, I chose Delta regardless if I had to take two flights to get to my destination cause they still had social distant seating on all their flights. Which made me feel comfortable since it'd be my first time flying since the pandemic started. Check in at OKC wasn't a hastle. Since I have a Gold Card, they still accepted my bag even though it was a few pounds over the limit. At the gate, I spoke to the agent handling boarding about the precautions. She was very nice and descriptive about their cleanliness and cleaning procedures. She was kind enough to give me a goodie bag filled with cookies, sanitizing wipes and a thank you post card. Flight to SLC from boarding to landing was ontime, smooth and pleasant. Connection at SLC was a little surprising. I learned we'd be deplaning at a remote spot and be bussed to the terminal due to construction I wasn't aware they were doing on some of the terminals. When we deplaned, we had to share two buses with another flight that had just arrived. Both buses ended up being at full capacity. Meaning we weren't able to social distance for the entire bus ride. In this environment, that was dangerous to do. I feel Delta could've done a better job mitigating this issue. Afterwards, the rest of the connection was fine. Boarded, departed and arrived on time. Flight attendants on the flight were nice enough to let me move to an empty row because of my discomfort of sharing a row with another passenger, even though the middle seat was open. Overall, great experience with Delta in a pandemic. If they could just be more cautious about their remote stand connection process, that would be best. I have plans to fly Delta again in a month while they still have their social distant seating arrangement. Looking forward to it and experiencing a different connection process in SLC. Thanks Delta!"

I so appreciate that Delta has chosen to keep the middle seat open to keep comfort and safety a priority. The crew has had to put up with a lot of pushback and I again appreciate how gracious their approach has been to navigate through this delicate climate. From the captains reminding passengers of the current rules to the crew politely reminding us that enforcing them is a requirement, it has been a year of travel facilitated by the hard working Delta employees. Thank you for allowing me to continue working without having to worry about my safety. You are appreciated."

Every conversation I had with a Delta representative left me feeling upset and hurt. I needed to change my return flight due to some weather problems and I had to talk to 2 different people but call back 3 times because halfway through our conversation the line would randomly cut out for me to never get a call back. When I would call back I would get the same representative who would sound surprised when I called back. They never gave us much confirmation and were all over the place trying to figure out how to change my flight. I am overall not happy with how Delta have treated me. It was not even one person it was multiple staff at the airport and with representatives on the phone.
1029,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Savannah to Ontario,February 2021,1,1,,,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ,"  They had a “maintenance issue” with some battery part missing on the plane (you’d think they would check further in advance than right as soon as we boarded the plan). They had to fly in another part for the aircraft and had us wait for several hours on the plane and then de board and wait several more. They had one ticket agent help to rearrange connecting flights so we stood in line for hours while they tried to rebook. My flight was unable to be rebooked through delta so I had to book an entirely new flight which they did not cover the cost. Terrible experience. This is the second time they’ve had a maintenance issue. And within a few days of each other. Very unprofessional, rude staff."

I called to fix something on my itinerary and was talked to very snappily, rudely, and the lady was very short with me. She talked to me as if I was completely ignorant, like she had no time for me, and like I was way beneath her. I love flying with Delta but this frustrated me so much that I will definitely be reconsidering for my future flights. I’ve never understood why people get a job within customer service if they can’t even pretend to be nice humans. This was definitely a conversation that could have easily been talked through. I wasn’t complaining or being a pain - just had to fix a minor detail on my ticket-nothing crazy. Disappointed for sure. "

No other airline matches their level of service online, at the gate, and in the cabin. Customer Service texting has added another higher level of service to Delta customers.

I was supposed to leave at 1655 today. I am still in Tampa and don’t even know if I will have a connecting flight from Atlanta to Memphis. Delta staff has argued that I didn’t pay for a first class ticket when I give them my confirmation number and show pic of ticket. I don’t know what else I can show. The woman that changed my ticket said to call for a refund and  won’t give me one and everyone has been so incredibly rude. Delta are saying you can’t refund me and I can’t sit in first class and I have been delayed four or five times.  I understand delays out of your control but I do not understand the horrible service I have received today!

I'm a military service member, in the last 7 years, I traveled 4-5 times a year to ferry back and forth home, often using Delta. This is the first and hopefully, last time that I have been treated in such a horrible way by a ticket counter agent. I arrived with my dad and fiancee and from the moment we approached the counter, she consistently and relentlessly spoke to us like we children in an angry and dismissive tone of voice and manner. We were so confused about why we were being treated so poorly, we remained silent about her behavior, not wanting a confrontation because we didn't want to be delayed or delay those in line behind us. We were looking for additional assistance, she dismissed us by saying ""this is a ticket counter, all I do is check back.. move to the side, wait for a supervisor if you have other questions"" There is no way I'm using (or recommending anyone I know) to use Delta Airlines after this experience. If a ticket agent feels so empowered to treat a customer this way, there must be a systematic problem at that Boston station."

Then the nightmare started when after countless e-mails with customer service I was offered a voucher for future flights because I wasn’t able to provide my original receipt as it was a gift from my sister-in-law.

(They eventually got two but one handled Special Needs and the other handled Premiere members first.) But when I got there, they were irritated and clearly upset about working under those conditions. 2) I got stuck in a special TSA line and they went through every article in my purse and laptop bag. Something on my boarding pass, I presume? (Note, I am TSA Pre-Check approved but it was not on my boarding pass.) 3) I start boarding at the gate and the gate attendant charges me for my pet bag. In fact, she charged me more for a bag that sits under the seat than I paid for my entire flight! Toddlers are free and they cry the whole flight but a dog in a bag under the seat costs more than an adult person does?! Ridiculous! To make matters worse, the seats are so cramped that the bag hardly fits. (It fit great with Alaska Airlines!) Delta..get a clue!

Then I tried again and the next person said they will transfer me and after waiting for 20 minutes the call got disconnected. Next time, they said they will send me a cost calculation the next day and then I received an email saying they will not make any changes. How can it be this hard to change a flight?

I tell you the entire flight crew went over and above the call of duty, to locate my lost item. They made an announcement, they asked other passengers if they had seen it and would they look under their seats, they went back into the terminal area, they walked the walk way several times; everyone from the Head Flight Specialist to those assisting in the back were in on the search. But when the young lady got down on her knees and started searching, well words can not express my gratitude. So, would like to thank each and everyone of them.

Yes we cut it close, this airport is beyond confusing, but the one in Arkansas let her board 10 minutes before take off for unforeseen issues. Delta needs to hire more decent and competent staff. The second she saw me she dismiss me and then throughout the rest of the interaction antagonize me until I exploded and then of course and have any time to board the plane.

She then put me on hold twice without notice in the middle of me speaking. The Delta website is utter trash. The chat support wasn't working. Can't leave a complaint via your complaint submission page on this site. Just errors out both times I tried to submit one. Can't even leave a message via the Facebook Message option they mention here. It just redirects you to their support page on their site which is also broken. All you can do is call.

It was not what she said but how she said it. My flight was 5 hours delayed and this was at 6 hour flight at 4 in the morning. Then she woke me up twice because my mask had slipped a little down while I was asleep. I walked to the bathroom and clearly saw 6 or more people with masks completely off. I felt targeted. My 10 year old asked me why that flight attendant seemed out to get me. I have traveled during Covid many times. I have never experienced such a rude, heartless, unsympathetic flight attendant. My family and I were doing the best we could. Second time she woke me up, she threatened to have police meet my family at the gate. This is a ridiculous abuse of authority from a power hungry child who should clearly not be in the service industry.

The Delta response was: It was the fault of TSA, and it had probably to do with my last name being hyphenated. After that I called TSA in Midway, and the lady over the phone told me that I had failed to ask for the Airline to resubmit my reservation. Honestly, I had never heard of that resubmission before, and I have used my Global entry before many times. At that moment, I was really upset. What is the point of paying for Global entry then?

I waited for the shuttle bus for 10 minutes finally arriving back where I started at 0715. At this point I was clearly frustrated with the poor communication and efficiency of your employees. I asked to speak to a supervisor, again I had to wait 15 minutes. I explain my morning to her and her response was “Oh well these things happen”. I worked for the MTA NYCT and if one of my employees made this statement to one of our customers who was just put thru this, I would discipline them on the spot.

Might I add unlike large airports I was the only person in the entire airport and no flights where going out until noon so she knew I was there for her flight. I will never fly Delta again! I am now stuck in the airport for the next 7 hours.

A mechanical issue, that by the pilot’s announcement DID NOT effect the safety of the plan we were late taking off. We had 10 minutes to get to our connecting flight. We ran those 3 gates got to the gate 4 minutes before departure. Oh wait the connecting flight took off 10 minutes early. No possible way to get to my class on time the next day. Stuck in Atlanta over night just to fly home the next morning. Total lost funds due to deltas negligence: $80 hotel, $80 for car rental, $1800 CME course (all 3 canceled with less than 24 hours notice resulting in no refund). $900 for airline tickets for myself and patient. The course I was going to was a live patient training and I had to bring my own patient. Oh and that patient had taken the day off so lost income as well. This is why I will never fly Delta again."

He went out of his way to get my daughter and I boarding passes and overall made a very tired, stressed momma traveling with a 3 year old have a smoother experience after what could of been a very disapointing and irritable one.

At the end the flight was late more than an hour and I wouldn't be able to catch my connection flight. I had to ask to re-schedule my meeting and my request still pending!

They have 25 flights leaving around the same time and open 3 booths to drop your luggage. They also randomly chose to let passenger to a NYC flight go before everyone else, even if our flight was at the same time. Because they are so slow, passengers missed their flights so they had to book another flight again which made the waiting time even longer. Unless you want to arrive 3 or 4 hours before your flight to be able to catch it, fly with another company."

1070,1,,Business,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Los Angeles via Atlanta,July 2020,4,4,,3,3,,3,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Thanks Delta, for reminding me that my pockets are not deep enough for you all to care how me or my property is treated. I've been lied to, witnessed a clear violation of how things are supposed to be handled, and I've been ghosted. Some backstory: relocating as a remote worker. I packed my work equipment with multiple layers of bubble wrap and clothing, put them into a box, and sealed it with guerilla tape. I checked my box as an oversized special item to prevent any mishandling. The lady at the counter marked the box as fragile and oversized. She then told me that I could claim the item in a designated area as it would not drop down the conveyor belt. She then asked me to sign away all liability saying that they'll take REASONABLE care of my property but aren't liable for damages. Well, Delta's definition of reasonable care means that they'll stack boxes on top of a box marked fragile, send it over to standard baggage claim tumbling down the conveyor belt, bend the box(how?), Then the coup de grâce, puncture the box and it's content. So I see the box tumbling down the conveyor belt and I'm dmbfounded. This is not what was discussed. Its about to flip over the sides since it tumbled end over end but luckily It caught balance and landed with a thump back onto the belt. I go to the counter to explain to the lady who's clearly annoyed, what happened to my box. She asked me to test if everything in there works. I couldn't find the wires for the monitors and we ended up speaking to LAX. I pointed out every bend and hole on the box saying, this isn't reasonable care. After seeing the box the agent said I can go home to buy wires and test the monitors within 24hrs, email him and then we'll work something out if it's broken. I'm guessing this was to just get me out of the airport because he later ghosted me. The next morning I got some new wires and plugged in my BenQ which worked fine. I then unwrap my dell 27"" ultrasharp ips monitor and see what appears to be a hole that's penetrated the first two layers of the screen. Naive and hopeful, I plug in the monitor thinking that it'll still work and if it's just a scratch then I can live with that. But after plugging it in That scratch started to look more like fractures as the screen begin to illuminate. It was done. I called Delta's help support number, when I finally got through to someone I barely got out half a sentence before being interrupted. The gentleman proceeded to interrupt me a few more times until I finally got my story out and after a final interruption I just hung up. I emailed Scott to update him on the progress I had made, I also sent a message via Facebook messenger to Delta to figure out how to actually put a claim in for the issue. Scott replied back thanking me for keeping him in the loop. I finally got a ticket submitted and within an hour someone had already denied my claim. They offer me $250 travel coupon. I absolutely decline and you can remove it from my account then remove my account. I send another message to the agent , he was friendly so I'm sure he'd be willing to help, nope. He ghosted me. I've made quite a few trips with Delta in the past for work and I religiously chose them because of their seating space and how easy it is to check in. No more. I'd rather fly Spirit. You all really showed how much you value the 9-5 regular Joe. I bet if I was a frequent first class passenger"

When my son and I took the DL4747 connecting flight DL1059 and flew to Delta Air Lines in South Korea, we did not get on the plane smoothly due to some personal reasons. My son and I were very frustrated and helpless. At this time, a person in charge of Delta Air Lines helped us in time. She is a warm and kind angel. Her name is Kayleigh. I would like to thank her for helping us book a return flight ticket and at the same time keeping the flight ticket that we can change the international flight time at any time, so that my son and I no longer feel helpless and afraid.

1073,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Utah to Washington,May 2020,,,,,,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  I feel like they took advantage of us during this time of stress an hardship surrounding Corona virus. My wife had purchased a ticket for me to meet them in Washington for a spring break trip. Due to the Virus outbreak it was not a good idea to go forward with that trip rather than refund us during a worldwide pandemic they had to make sure they kept our money ""graciously"" offering us a future credit. When it came time that we felt we could use the credit they had a policy in place saying they couldn't change the name attached to the ticket. My wife (who originally purchased the ticket) was going to use the credit instead of me. They would not allow the change even though it was the same family, trip, customer, and even credit card. It's sad when a company clearly only cares about the money and in no means the customer. You would hope that eventually no one would continue to support businesses like this that take advantage of people during hard times or any time for that matter. If you were paid then you were paid. It shouldn't make a difference who uses the ticket if the purchaser wants to transfer it. Please don't support this company's future. We can get better service by not supporting companies who don't do good business."
1074,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Wichita,May 2020,2,2,,,2,,3,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I booked these tickets back on May 5th. The originally flight was supposed to be June 5th, from PDX to MSP to ICT. On May 23rd, I get an email that there had been some changes to my flight and that’s when I noticed they had me leaving at 123PM and arriving at 628PM is MSP, then to ATL and finally to my destination in ICT. The thing is, my connection flight at MSP was supposed to be at 9AM that same day. Unless the airline is on to something that I’m not aware about, that connection isn’t possible. I called the travel agency I booked my ticket through and the only way to fix this flight was to change the PDX to MSP flight to June 4th, same flight, same times just a day earlier with a 14 hour layover. I bit the bullet and said sure, go ahead and do that. I wake up, May 25th and Delta went ahead and changed my flight back to the original of my flight(s) all being on the same day. AGAIN, last time I checked that’s an impossible flight to make my connection. Called Delta, in attempt to fix something that I had already fixed the day prior and was put on hold for 3.5 hours to only have the call disconnected half way through. Called back and again, 3.5 hours and got “hung up” on. Gave up and went back to communicating through the travel agency. They then informed me, the MSP to ATL flight no longer exists and there was no way for me to make my flight unless I was willing to pay the difference for another flight. I told them to cancel my booking, because I didn’t want this to happen again, once I booked another flight through Delta. Ended up booking a flight through American for the one way ticket that was double the price I had paid, for the original round trip ticket! Never again will I fly with this airline. In the past I’ve never had these issues, but recently this airline has gone downhill!"

Have called Delta and they cant 'find' my booking that I made! back in January. I have the confirmation email, e-ticket, but they say that there is nothing that they can currently do as the booking doesn't exist. Would have changed the flights to the same time next year as due to the current situation we aren't going anywhere soon from the UK, and got a good deal in January on Premium seats. Frontier Airlines on the other hand refunded very quickly - not impressed with Delta's way of handling this, as they have always been a great airline in our opinion."
1077,1,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Fort Myers to Minneapolis/St Paul,May 2020,3,3,,,3,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Delta would not guarantee an empty seat beside me when I first booked first class. So I changed to a comfort seat with the middle row left empty. But the three other people in the same row had no masks. I asked the steward to get me a different seat but she said there is nothing she could do. Then the man who sat on the aisle closest to my window seat said he would wear a mask for me. Conclusion is that Delta emails you ahead of time stating they require masks. They reiterate this at the gate. They even offer masks if you don't have one. But a few people just refuse and can put an older woman with asthma, like me, at risk. If they are not asked to leave, as Delta says they will do, this will continue. In addition, Delta does not show all the selected seats on the seating selection chart, which misleads one regarding the number of people in your cabin. Imagine my shock when I was assured by the booking agent that the next two seats would be empty when only the middle seat was and the other three seats were filled with people without a mask."

I wanted to talk to the skymiles guys to see if I could upgrade to Comfort + using my points. The reservation agent said she would give me until 11 pm the next day to pay for the ticket and would switch me to the skymiles guy and I could either pay for the ticket with my credit card while talking to him and find out if I could use my points to upgrade at the same time. Transferred me, spent another hour on hold, finally got a guy and in the middle of our conversation we got cut off. Got a confirmation email from Delta, but when I tried to pay for the ticket online it could not find the reservation. Called Delta again, again on hold for well over an hour. When I did get through I was told that the ticket price was no longer what I was quoted but had increased to $811.00. I was well within the grace period for purchasing the ticket. I was not told by the first agent that the price was subject to an increase. Talked to a supervisor who said there was nothing he could do, so I paid the difference. This is bait and switch. "

The customer service representative consulted with a supervisor and agreed to give me a full refund without penalties as this was a COVID-19 related situation. As of 4/28/20 I have not received a refund. After spending much time in a call queue, a representative informed me that a refund would not be coming and I would only receive a voucher with time limitations, despite being told that I would receive a full refund in March. I was then transferred to another customer service representative who would only repeat the same lines over and over again. The representative refused to provide me with a transcript of my previous call, refused to transfer me to another person to provide assistance, and was incredibly rude and condescending. He would not send me anything in writing, stating a policy that he couldn’t provide me with either. The representative acknowledged that I was told to expect a refund and then told me that I would never get a refund and that no one in Delta could help me. He then hung up on me after I again asked to speak with someone who could help me. Delta is refusing to honor a refund that was already promised by a Delta employee who was authorized to promise a refund. Delta's customer service is extremely offensive. It is very clear that their only role is to stonewall customers in hopes that they give up and go away. I will continue to lobby for my refund because a: it was promised to me and b: I will never willingly fly with Delta again and so a voucher is useless to me."

I wanted to take this time to highlight the good. On March 13th I was in Miami and the corona-virus was becoming a huge issue and my mom thought it would be a good idea that I flew home and I too thought it would be a good idea so I proceeded to book my flight to leave the following morning. When I booked the flight I thought I put insurance on the ticket turns out I did not. The next morning came and unfortunately I missed my flight I was a bit upset but not surprised because I honestly was not prepared. Knowing that I had not put insurance on the ticket I was upset that I would now be out of $130. With everything going on, money no matter the amount, is very much needed for rainy days but I knew that my own irresponsibility had put me in this position so I just let the situation go. So fast forward to today, March 31st, I had got paid and when I went to go check my account there was an extra $130 in my account. Of course at this point I had forgotten all about the ticket and I had already knew I didn't buy the ticket insurance so I was not at all expecting any type of refund. So I went in my payment history to see where the money had come from and sure enough it said ""Delta Airlines"". That's the difference between a good company and a GREAT company. I just wanted to say I truly appreciate the Delta community because they did not at all have to do that, but they did! And as I stated before people tend to shed light on all of the bad things before they sit and appreciate the good and that honestly made my day! Thank you guys for all that you do."

I want to bring an extra suitcase without checking it for more grubby hands to be touching my stuff. But no, Delta badly wants to touch your bags and collect an extra fee. Southwest didn't give me grief for this issue so I'm only flying Southwest. Plane is more comfortable than Southwest's crammed seats but in this pandemic I don't like their baggage policies.

Issues have ranged from damage to expensive suitcases, no food with first class tickets on the plane, rude airline staff, rude and stupid supervisors in customer service that cannot do simple math. You name it. So, I have decided never ever to fly Delta or any Sky team airlines again. This applies also to all my staff.

Our flight was initially scheduled for Tuesday Mar 17th, however the weekend leading up, Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada began urging Canadian citizens and residents to return home. With customer service phone-lines bogged up because of the crisis, we decided to take our chances and head to the airport a day early to see if there was any chance we could return sooner. Luckily, we were met with Dionne at the Delta Check-In (Terminal 2, at LaGuardia airport). Dionne had to deal with a faulty system that forced her to enter our passport credentials manually, but she handled it with grace and humour (which was really needed at that moment). She also did everything she could to find all the options available to us. Thankfully, she was able to get us on a flight later that day, direct to Toronto. Regardless of that, she acted as a professional, very calm and direct, and most importantly as a compassionate human to two Canadians hopped up on little sleep and lots of anxiety and uncertainty. Needed in these times. So above all else, thank you Dionne for how you stepped up, and likely stepped up before, and will continue to have to step up for your customers and staff.

So we called and ask to get a direct flight. We waited 3 hours to make changes. Once we agreed to the changes we had to pay a small fee. When we were about to pay they hang up on us. So we called back since we really wanted to get a direct flight and they took 4 hours to respond .. it was 1:30 am and they finally responded just to tell us that everything was sold out and that the only option was to pay for first class and the fee would be 1000 dollars!

Fully retrofitted 767 felt brand new even though it was 20 years old! Far superior to United’s 767-400 product I flew last year! Not only was the plane refurbished but the service had been recently enhanced! Flight was only half full which obviously helped! Delta start the service with a peach Bellini which was really nice! They also offered headphones and an eye mask as well as proper sized bottle of water. A menu leaflet was also offered. Dinner was a choice of 2 starters and 3 mains. I had harissa shrimp and the ravioli which again were both really tasty. Followed with a gin and tonic and some ice cream. Seat was comfortable enough for the 6hr flight, good cushioning and great headrest although the pitch was a little tight but adequate. A decent quality blanket and pillow were also distributed. Fantastic IFE system and free basic WiFi to message on! Crew were very relaxed and informal and came round with regular water and juice runs. A small cinnamon danish and drinks were served prior to landing. For a short economy transatlantic crossing Delta’s retrofitted 767-400 would be my choice!"

Delta has been making a concerted effort to improve the flying experience and my last four flights testifies to that. On this journey, the plane had quite a few unoccupied seats - I had the entire row to myself! What a pleasant difference it makes not to feel packed in! Flight attendants were efficient, beverage and snacks were served, pilots kept us informed, the aircraft was tidy, and the plane departed and arrived on time! What more could one ask for? The connecting flight from Minneapolis to Fargo was on a smaller plane and there was no inflight service. Again, there were empty seats which made boarding and disembarking quick and no hassles with stashing the oversized winter jackets we have on at this time of the year in that part of the country. It too was on time -- its departure gate was at another end of the sprawling airport at Minneapolis which necessitated quite a hike but connecting time was ample. Good job, Delta! Keep it up."

What is not forgivable is the lies I was told by numerous Delta representatives nearly every day. I was told that my luggage had been recovered the day after it went missing. The automated message assured me that my property would be on its way to me later that day or the day after. This went on every day of my Christmas holiday until the bag arrived the day after I left. I spent hours on the phone waiting for answers and was told that I would not be charged for the bill. I eventually received a massive bill that Delta refused to reimburse me for. They awarded me credit vouchers to the value of half of my phone bill. My bag was missing for one month despite me knowing its exact location every day of its misplacement. I asked Delta many times to let me take care of recovering it but they refused and promised to take care of as soon as possible. Whether pure incompetence, dishonesty or carelessness, I cannot forgive Delta for ruining my Christmas holidays. Offering me a credit voucher for my inconvenience and no refund for the phone bill that I was told I wouldn't have to pay is shameful in my opinion. I feel like Delta employees are told to provide no information to the customer until he/she loses interest in their claim and simply goes away."
1108,1,,Business,Economy Class,New York to Dallas Ft Worth,February 2020,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  New York to Dallas Ft Worth. When it comes to choosing an airline, I am sure many would agree with me that the biggest factor in this decision is trust. Trusting the airline to get you to your destination safely. Trusting them to take care of your luggage. Trusting them to provide you with accurate information with anything regarding your travels. I have trusted Delta Airlines for a very long time. I am even a Delta SkyMiles member, as I had planned on being a customer of theirs for a very long time. But I am afraid to say that that trust has reached its demise after today. Today, I flew to Dallas for a business trip that included a golf outing. I was particularly excited about this golf outing, as I had just bought a brand new $300 club that I was very eager to try. However, the club did not come in the mail before I had to ship the rest of my clubs out via a 3rd party service. I immediately called Delta to see if bringing a single golf club onto the plane was possible. I was very doubtful that this would be allowed, but I thought it would be worth making a phone call just to make sure. When I called Delta’s baggage support line, the man who answered the phone told me in complete confidence that it would not be an issue. I even made sure to ask if I would have any trouble getting it through security. He assured me that it would be fine and that I could store the club in the planes closet or just hold it with me in my seat. This information made me very happy and reinforced the high quality of service and excellence that I believed Delta Airlines provided to all their passengers. When I arrived at the airport, I went to check in a bag. While I was at the counter, 3 women were standing there as one of them was checking in my bag. Not one of them noticed the golf club I was carrying and recommended that I checked it in. But why would they? They were probably just as clueless of the rules and regulations as the man I spoke with on the phone. I got to the front of security with 30 minutes until my flight was supposed to leave when one of the officers told me that I was not allowed to bring my club through. I assured him that I spoke with Delta and they said it was ok. It turns out that all sporting equipment must be checked in, no matter how small it may be. I sprinted back to the check in desk to try and check the club in, but it was too late to do so. I even tried to go store it, but the crew was switching shifts and would not be open for another 15 minutes. I did not have 15 minutes. Long story short, I was forced to throw away a brand new $300 golf club because of the false information that I was provided by Deltas clueless support team and the lack of awareness of their check-in team.  It is safe to say that I will never be flying Delta again and I hope that my story will show others that Delta cannot be trusted."

Overall a great experience with Delta Air Lines on their A220-100 aircraft. We were actually allowed 1 free checked bag per person allowing us to put all of our baggage into the hold and simply ignore the overhead bins. We actually departed five minutes ahead of schedule as the boarding process went very smoothly. This was the first time I ever had a flight depart ahead of schedule and I have to say it worked out very well. The seating was amazing and the seats all had massive padded headrests which were also adjustable, something very rare on such a small narrowbody aircraft. The food was also amazing and Delta have a wide variety of complimentary snacks and beverages, but I also got their protein box -s easily worth the $9 I paid for it. The only thing holding this back from a 10/10 was that the in-flight entertainment system on my plane wasn't working, but an issue like this is quite rare. We just got unlucky, but I didn't mind it all that much as I slept for most of the flight. Overall, this flight was well worth waking up at 2:30 A.M, as this was easily the best domestic flight I have ever flown on (even with the nonfunctional IFE.)"

I realize I wasn't sitting in 1st class, a but it was really difficult to sit there drinking my lukewarm water while the flight attendant in 1st class was busily serving them constantly! I also realize it was a rough flight, but they could have done something for us other than this terrible water! At the end of the trip, they had the nerve to ask us to take our own trash out. I left my one little plastic cup. I left it behind with the trash that was left by the previous passenger that was in my seat. They didn't even bother to clean up after their passengers before they boarded us! Clearly that person was not served only one little cup of lukewarm water. They were obviously served the snacks and wine, which is what I thought I was going to get as a passenger in Comfort Plus. I, on the other hand, never even saw our flight attendant again after she handed me that cup of lukewarm water. I will never fly Delta again!"

We arrived at the airport about an hour before our flight and the first representative sent us to another, full-service counter. By the time we were assisted at the ""correct"" ticket counter, the flight was scheduled to depart in 40 minutes. Instead of Delta making an exception for the 5 minutes we were late to check in our bags (apparently you have to arrive no later than 45 minutes before the departure time), they told me there was nothing they could do and that if I wanted to transfer my ticket, it was going to cost $618 per person (x3), or I could just buy three new tickets for the next flight (4 hours later) for $488 per person,  which included my significant other and my 4 year old.  Delta made ZERO attempt to assist my family in getting home, getting our bags to the plane, or even the next flight would have been fine, and gave us a choice: You either cough up at least $1,500 or we are out of luck. We had to spend $600 in renting a car, staying at a hotel, gas and purchasing meals to drive from Atlanta to Miami for 10+ hours of driving time. This was a power play on behalf of Delta and I will take this into consideration when booking my next flight. ALL Delta cares about is money."

This didn’t work for me because I didn’t have 25 minutes to spare after landing. I kindly asked if I could just check if there was room in the overhead bins. At the gate they said sure no problem. As I entered the plane a stewardess confronted me rudely and told me I had to check the bag. Again I kindly asked if I could just check if there was room as I was the last passenger on the plane and the delay would make me late already. She angrily told me there is no room with her hand on my bag. I said ok, sure, and she took my bag back out. I’m not exaggerating, on the way to my seat (22F) I literally passed 12-15 bag spaces in the plane. Really dumb that they made me check my bag."

I took Delta flights multiple times between Europe and Seattle in the past 2 years and am still wondering how this airline has got only 3 stars. Based on my experience DL has the best long haul economy service that no other carrier I have ever used could beat (LH, OS, EK, KL, QR, HU). The reasons are the next: 1) A330s and 767s: 2-whatever-2 layout is much more traveller friendly than 3-whatever-3 (worst experience is KL’s 787). 2) stable wifi: Gogo did a great job. This time there was some short connectivity issue over the Canadian permafrost 3) clean cabin: I don’t know why this is a big challenge for others, but if you collect garbage frequently, then the cabin will stay clean 4) surprisingly good food and beverages: first time in my life I liked airline meal. SweetWater ale is also a big plus. Delta might do a decent job only on the Seattle routs but they do a really great job there. Hopefully, European and other North American airlines will recognize the difference and will follow Delta’s quality."
1117,2,,Business,Economy Class,Cancun to Pittsburgh via Atlanta,February 2020,2,2,2,4,1,3,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I had a flight from Cancun to Pittsburgh connecting through Atlanta yesterday. On my first flight, a cup of coffee was spilled on my lap after the passenger sitting next to me was bumped by the flight attendant and spilled her coffee. I accept accidents happen and I managed as best I could despite being wet and sticky. I shrugged this off and hurried to immigration/ customs. I have global entry and only had carry-on luggage and saw that there was a 2 hour earlier flight on Delta (15699) that would allow me to get home sooner, out of my sticky clothes and permit me to surprise my 8 year old son by getting to his swim competition in time. From online, it appeared there were over 20 seats open in the main cabin. I stopped at the delta baggage desk right after Customs and asked if this was possible and they said yes but that I had to run up to the gate since it was already boarding. I did just that- I ran! I got myself from the F concourse to the B concourse, Gate 5 and the area was clear, the gate was open for another 5 minutes and was staffed by an agent. I had to rest for 30 seconds just to catch my breath. I explained the agent what the Delta agents had told me to do. His response- was flat and dismissive ""Are you a Delta Platinum member?"" ""Are you A Delta Gold Member?"" I said no to both queries. His next response ""Well then you will have to pay $75 for a ticket change."" I explained that the representatives had indicated this would not be a problem as there were so many seats open- I was already travelling on Delta and normally this flight would not be available to me book as the time between flights is too small to be permitted to book during the initial reservation. I explained how my clothes were now sticky as a result of the coffee being spilled on me. I explained about my 8 year old and wanting to get home. None of this mattered. I was nobody to the agent. My impression after this - Delta only cares about you if you are a Platinum or Gold member. (Ironically I had considered, an hour earlier while in flight, applying for the platinum card as my husband sits on the American Board of Plastic Surgeons and flies often for board meetings. Suffice to say- I will stick with my existing airline credit cards and skip Delta's card as I do not see myself electively travelling on Delta in the future). I begged the agent to call a supervisor - he did but he dawdled and the gate was just 2 minutes from closing. I watched painfully as the door closed and the plane took off and the agent didn't care. There was no empathy, no compassion. Nothing.  I couldn't believe that this Delta agent would let me stand there, bag in hand, knowing he could have been kind and allowed me to see my family earlier, see my son compete and offset my unfortunate 'coffee in the lap' experience. I couldn't believe that he let me sit there knowing how many seats were empty on that flight just to make a point -pay the $75 or wait without reason. The irony is that my scheduled delta flight, 2 hours later, was so full that they had customers waiting in standby. That agent could have freed up my seat if he had let me get on the earlier flight. Poor service all the way around. I will avoid Delta whenever possible."

I have been flying with Delta for my whole life. 40+ years of flights and all over the world. But I'm starting to notice that their service is becoming as second rate as other airlines. I was recently flying home on Christmas Eve and was so early to the gate that me and my colleague decided to grab a quick bite very close by. As we sat there and eventually watched other passengers board, we finished our meal and headed back over to the gate. When we got there they informed us they had given our seats away. No intercom, no warning, nothing -- just oversold and a whole bunch of people trying to get to their families in time for Christmas. So they bumped us. The next two flights were also oversold and so we had to buy two new tickets to get home late that night. It took us 9 extra hours to get home and had to fly through Seattle instead of on the direct flight we had seats for. We got to SLC late and many passengers were trying to get to connecting flights. One woman, in particular, had a young sleepy girl and was carrying large bags. She had only a few minutes to get to her gate and was going to miss her flight. We picked up her bags and sprinted no less than a half mile to the other terminal and caught them as they were closing the doors. We told her a woman was coming with her baby and to please hold the flight. It was an honor to get this poor woman and her child on her flight and we saved Delta from her missing her plane on Christmas Eve. That would have been 100% their fault. Now - I just spent 2 hours on the phone hoping Delta would show us a courtsey of some kind of credit for having to spend an extra $750 on new tickets to get home. Their customer service talked over me, did not employ good English, was disrespectful and told me it was all my fault. Even if that's true - why would you not do all you can to save a customer or to take care of a customer who has been so loyal? Why be just like so many other airlines? Delta has become too big and is losing what made them special. I can't believe I'm saying this - but I will choose them last from here on out. So truly disappointing."

Boarding relatively efficient and uneventful. The seat was ok - not too cramped by comparison to other carriers. IFE was good and had a good amount of content, and a good size screen. The main meal service was surprisingly good and tasted really fresh for an economy service. the quantity of food was also good. The pizza snack before landing was ok but not as good as the main meal service.The crew were good, curteous and professional, although overall I think they could have checked on us a bit more often. They seemed to get the main meal service done and then disappeared for hours without appearing at all. Overall a good experience which I would recommend."

Before my return flight, I suffered hours of delays until they finally cancelled the flight late that night. They offered no vouchers for food or hotel. Although I had paid for first class, the next day I flew home in a back seat by the families and bathrooms. This treatment is par for the course for Delta. I’m used to it. But what frosted my cake was, just this weekend, I signed into Delta to choose my Diamond benefit certificates. They were all closed out. Turns out I was one day late! I wrote Delta, explaining that I had missed their guideline by a day, that it was my fault, and could they help me? I quickly received this curt one-line reply: “Unfortunately, once these expire or are used, these certificates cannot be reopened.” If this is how they treat their very best customers, how do you think they’ll treat you?

I don't recommend it, the food is cold almost everything is for pay and plates are from paper. In my opinion those cannot be served in business class lounge in such a large airline like delta."

My second leg flight was canceled as we were landing in Narita, with no explanation. Some passengers were given seats on another flight to Manila immediately. Most of us were told we’d have to stay in Japan for a day or two. None of the Delta employees knew what to do, they just kept pushing us out of the airport. Immigration was puzzled too. They gave us two meal vouchers for a restaurant in the hotel. The times were very restrictive. After I checked in I took a nap and when I woke up my voucher had expired. Delta sucks. When I arrived in the morning to check in the Delta counter was closed. I will never fly with Delta again."

This caused us to arrive Fort Meyers at 9:00 pm instead of 5:30 pm. Totally blew our evening plans. All Delta said they could do was give us 2500 points (which will buy you a cup of coffee on a flight you a pay $400 for). I called customer care and they added another 1000 points (I can now enjoy some cookies with my coffee). No longer are they my airline of choice. I would have at a minimum expected two $400 vouchers. Poor customer care.

I used my frequent flier miles to take this trip and was able to secure aisle seats at the time of booking. Both outbound and inbound flights had all seats occupied and overhead cabins, though generous in size, were stuffed with bags and winter clothes. Snack service provided once. Flights were more or less on schedule. The lavatories in the 737-900 were unbelievably compact - no space to even take a picture to show that. They were at the very rear of the aircraft. On the 757 too the lavatories are at the very back. It is a long walk and woe for the passengers in those back rows having to bear people congregating to use the bathrooms. Seats equipped with TV monitor with a good selection of films available plus the air show where one can track the flight. Leg space just adequate. Flight attendants friendly. Boarding, though orderly, looked and felt chaotic as we all waited anxiously for our group to be called as we saw others board with big bags. I guess we were fearing we would not find space for our own bags when we got in. The boarding gate staff repeatedly solicited that we check the bags for free. Some did. I did not! I got lucky and found space to stash my backpack, ski jacket, and a small roller suitcase. All in all, it was a frantic experience at both ends to board the plane!"

Not a single delta employee for flight 1944 was helpful. The airline separated my two year old and me and the gate attendants told me there was absolutely nothing they could do. I was emotionally stressed because I wasn’t going to have my two year old sitting next to me on a four hour plane ride and she was going to be sitting next to strangers. To top it off the gate attendant told me that I was being rude when I was frustrated and being blown off and that I should apologize to the other attendant. She was the nastiest person to deal with.

We had been downgraded on our flights from premium economy to economy due to over booking and miss placing our seating. We had been giving random seats all of premium the catch was we were a family of 5, 2 adults 3 kids ages from 3 to 12. Very annoyed to pay for a comfy seat to be put at the back of the plane and me in the very last row. Had no idea this happened until all of our original cabin was filled and our tickets had been re issued. The worst thing was we were at the gate before anybody else and I asked the flight staff to organise this with plenty of time. I do hope there is a refunding process for this muck around. I will never fly Delta again as even on our flight to the USA the on board crew where very unprofessional and rude. 2 flights with Delta long haul, both very disappointing. Very tiring. Very expensive."

I flew from Paris CDG to JFK and back on their economy class. The ground staff are grumpy, they don’t smile.  When I entered the airplane, I was shocked to see the dirty carpet on the floor.  I got to my row and I couldn’t sit in my seat because the flight attendant was in the space, leaning over to the row behind to chat with the passenger seated there. The seats are narrow. Maybe I am too used to Asian, European and Middle Eastern carries where the airplane is always clean (as you embark) whether you’re in business or economy class and the staff is courteous and greet you with smiles. I also fly budget airlines like for short trips and those airplanes are clean and both ground and air crew are nice too. The only saving grace of that Delta flight is that the food is decent and they have unlimited snacks throughout the flight. Never flying Delta again."

But I recall that I was not given a complimentary even once last year. So rather than buy first round trip to SLC from JFK I decided to wait until 5 days before my return flight to get upgraded as there were plenty of seats left. Guess what? About 6 days before the flight, my app showed no seats available in first, even for dollars or miles. So I got on line with my wife's login and was able to buy a first class ticket on that flight with a choice of several open seats! The rules keep changing, folks. And fellow Diamonds  beware.

We arrived at the airport very early on a connecting flight ; another flight leaves in 3 hours that is half empty. I asked to be put on this earlier flight due to a high winds advisory in my home airport and my son's disability, which makes long waits in a busy place challenging. I provided documentation from weather.com of this advisory. Delta loses nothing by putting me on this earlier flight and only to gain my customer satisfaction. However, their customer service agents refused offering no explanation. Teresa at Montego Bay was my last conversation and she was not polite or helpful. I have routinely made similar switches to an earlier flight on Delta and other airlines even when no wind advisory existed. I will think twice about using Delta again due to this poor service."
1136,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to New York,December 2019,3,1,2,3,2,3,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Miami to New York. We were a party of 6 flying to New York for our Winter Break. We had 3 minors traveling with us, the youngest was 11 and was nervous about flying. We did not pay the extra fee to choose our seats because we has flown other times on other airlines and never had to pay to be seated together. We really do not have a preference where on the plane we sit as long as we are seated together. This has been the first time ever that all of us were seated in completely different rows throughout the plane. All of us got middle seats between 2 strangers. I was very upset that my kids had to fly alone and sit between 2 strangers. I asked the flight attendant to please help me find someone to switch seats so that at least my youngest son would not have to be alone. She offered to come see me once we were on the plane and try to help me but no one ever came to me. I asked the person next to me who was an adult flying alone if she would switch with my son and she refused to. It is very upsetting to know that this airline only cares about making extra money on allowing people to pay for choosing their seats even if it means splitting up children from their families.  I kept thinking what if those adults are watching or saying something inappropriate next to my child, or something even worse. Also, if it had been a flight with turbulence, he would've been very nervous alone. Flying can be scary even for many adults. After this experience, I will definitely never fly Delta again which is a shame because they do have comfortable seats and offer snacks and drinks which many other airlines do not. They also have movies to choose from which help the flights go by faster. I have flown with my family many times and have never had this happen. It really should not be allowed. I will not recommend this airline to anyone traveling with their family."

Our flight was redirected to Honolulu on our way to Auckland due to a medical emergency among the staff. The problem is that we were offered compensation but not on our terms. We were not allowed to upgrade on our way home. We could only use the voucher on a new flight. That is cheeky in my opinion. It should be at our discretion. When we were in conversation with Delta representatives, they were less than kind and very unprofessional. I understand that emergencies happen, but we booked a vacation and lost an entire day sitting in an airport that was not on our itinerary."

Everything functioned as intended for the duration of the trip. Seats could be better on the Airbus, the footwell space is a major issue on these business class seats when all flat, but fine when upright. Food always good out of ATL to Europe, generally a pleasant experience. I’ve always liked Delta’s D1 product and although not quite up to the lofty standards of the middle east carriers, I think it’s good value when you can take advantage of their Leisure fares."

Delta transferred me to an Alaska Airlines flight departing the same time but forgot to transfer my bags with my ticket. Delta refused to compensate anything for the inconvenience and two delays. The baggage delay staff shifted the blame on Alaska Airlines twice, claiming I've made claims with them (which I haven't). Just a clear shift of blame and lack of integrity to own up to their company's mistakes. Will never fly with such a shady airline again. Poorly played, Delta."

It is not. There is more room on Korean Air economy. So for the return, I upgraded to Delta One. Little did I know this was the worst flight I would have ever taken.  First, my seat would not recline even though the seats a re supposed to lay flat., my TV stopped working an hour into the flight. I had no entertainment, nor did I have any concept of time since I couldn’t see where I was in flight. In Delta One, you can only turn on the light or call the flight attendant through the monitor. Well, since mine didn’t work I had to get up each time to find an attendant because they were never around. When I first told the flight attendant that my television did not work, her response to me was, “I am not a mechanic”. The meals were cold. I had to use my flashlight on my phone to see.  The door to my seat got stuck where I had to jam it open. And the charger worked intermittently throughout the flight. And I was told it was a brand new plane.  I had no rest and was tired and sleepy when I arrived in Seoul, yet I still had to conduct my meetings. My flight was worse than an economy ticket. One if the flight attendants offered me miles and I told them I want the money back because it was not a business class experience at all. I had originally paid $703 to upgrade to Premium select until my first flight so I upgraded to Delta One for $1,532. After my flight I requested to be refunded for my upgrade. I was told they would refund my ticket upgrade and would give me $724. I told them that was not my upgrade amount. Then they wrote me back and said that was half of the amount for the upgrade. I would never fly nor recommend this airline. It is just like all the other American airlines - poor customer service, filled with arrogant employees. This was my first time with Delta and my last."

Our first venture consisted of delays and lost luggage. Recently we were en route to a very important family event that we ended up missing. The ticket counter said “the pilots aren’t here yet” 30 minutes after we were supposed to board. Then there was a problem with the plane that needed repair, I’m all for that. However, we took off almost 1.5 hours after the initial time and missed our connection. Had to stay in Seattle as the next flight wasn’t until the next day, Delta covered that. On the way back they over booked the flight and said we couldn’t board until 4 volunteers accepted $1000 to stay. I called and talked with Delta about this and the response was 2 $100 gift cards. (She did mention she was told to offer only $25 but did more because she felt bad) I talked to a staff member who was very apologetic and comforting. But I feel like that just isn’t good enough. They refused anything more because they paid for our dumpy hotel when we were stranded in Seattle. I’ll definitely be flying Alaska Airlines from now on, they have not one time let us down. This was the last straw for Delta."

It remained empty except for my backpack and wife’s purse. Then at the carousel my wife’s bag did not come. Went to lost bags the bag had been opened. Furthermore my mom and daughter were on another flight boarded they were immediately asked to deboard. Said there was issue with the wing.

I understand delays and such however I do not understand scheduling my flight to land at one time and my connecting flight to leave 20 minutes later. Without delay that still leaves virtually no window to get to your next flight. All of this I can somewhat swallow. My biggest issue are the employees that work the airports. The staff on the planes are great however the other while “professional” are very unhelpful nor do they help. They clearly show they don't care about us and hide behind fake smiles. I will never fly Delta Air Lines again for this simple fact. Perhaps you can remind your employees that this is still customer service.

Nothing was exceptional or horrible. However, they called pre-boarding for passengers with medical equipment or additional time requirements. I utilize a CPAP because I am diagnosed with severe sleep apnea (nevermind the fact that I am also a service member and most airlines recognize this and offer early boarding for that reason alone). The ticket agent was very curt and made a huge deal about me only having a CPAP. Who is she to discriminate my medical condition and reduce it as something not important? I felt embarrassed, but she eventually allowed me to pass when I refused to be put down by her horrible behavior. I will never use Delta again and will discourage others from doing so as well."

When approaching the attendant at the service counter, the answer was that they have no further information that they could not guarantee the departure time of 6:30 and to take a complementary cookie and be comfortable. Everyone scheduled to be in this flight was treated with disgusting corporate arrogance. As a family traveling with three kids and paying full price for plane ticket. I think we deserved a little bit better than a complementary snacks. In any other type of business company’s are more held to account but airlines get away with their paying customers like crap."

Like any airline, I’ve had a hit-or-miss experience with Delta. All in all though, I’ve been impressed with them in recent years. Staff is usually pretty good, seats, entertainment and flight attendants are often exceptional, etc. One complaint, is the economy basic seat assignment algorithms don’t seem to put travelers together initially (hard to verify this, but on a return trip my wife and I were separated on 3 of the 4 legs). Most times it seems like the gate does manage to rearrange seats, but it’s an unnecessary stress/step. It feels like they separate basic economy passengers so (a) they pay to get seats together, or (b) Delta looks good by getting them back together. I guess after traveling for a few decades, I came to expect sitting next to my wife as a basic requirement of service, so the entire extent of any negativity in this review should be attributed to my discontent over the shift away from that strategy. Otherwise, I am fairly impressed with Delta flights."
1152,5,,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to Boston,December 2019,1,3,3,3,1,1,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Seattle to Boston. Delta is one of the few North American carriers clinging to some sense of ethical transportation. The seats are not comfortable but functional, the planes can be inconsistent with awkward or ok leg space, the service is decent and often comforting, there are still video screens on the seats (although some are so tiny it's almost a joke), and they are serving some food again which is a nice touch. It still has some serious problems with the overhead bins being tiny; the pilot and flight attendants entreated us 5 or so separate times to NOT put your small backpack and jacket in the bins, but to place them on the ground to make space for roller bags. I should not be punished for packing light and only having a small backpack, and I refuse to put the blazer i will be wearing the following day in an interview on the ground. The bathrooms were a total disaster throughout the flight, with urine covering the floor, tissues everywhere, and garbage overflowing. Delta can improve dramatically, but unfortunately this is close to the best available from USA carriers at the moment"

Sat in Comfort+ and the seats were reasonably comfortable with plenty of leg room. We were delayed getting off the ground due to an Air Traffic Control slow down (during the nationwide strikes on December 6th) but the flight crew kept us informed. We had to take a bus to a remote stand so boarding was somewhat slow and disjointed. That was not announced in advance but became obvious when there was no Delta aircraft at the gate. Once on board, the service was excellent. This was our third international trip on Delta this year and the cabin crews are significantly better than most airlines I have flown recently (with the possible exception of some of the Asian airlines). After take off the crew gave out water bottles and amenity kits then followed that with a welcome on board drink. Then meal service with three options (outlined on the printed menu and flight schedule which had been handed out at the start of the flight). During the flight the flight attendants came through four times offering water or juice and I also saw the flight attendants bring drinks to those who requested them. Snacks were available any time at the back of the plane. A pre-arrival snack with more beverages was offered about an hour before the end of the flight. Just before arrival, the flight attendants came around with farewell candies (in this case mini Toblerone bars) and thanked everyone for flying Delta. Outside of a some minor distractions - the awkward bus transport and restrooms showing their age - the flight was very good. The Delta crew did a great job (which was also consistent with our recent experiences on Delta international flights)."

Delta will rearrange their seats last minute to accommodate family needs regardless of other people's circumstances. They will pay the same price ticket but boot you out of your seat to put someone else's needs before you. Families who were unable to book without enough courtesy of others should find another flight. No one should have to feel that their needs outweigh another's. I paid the same price as others. I should be given the courtesy to sit on the seat I was offered and reserved. I was further displeased to learn that others on the same flight had been displaced.

The food is above average when compared to other international flights. That makes long journey more comfortable as the food is good. Though on the other hand, the plate is a bit too small. Flight is on time and good, even the CLT-ATL flight arrives 15 minutes before ETA, an early arrival is always good. Inflight entertainment and Wi-Fi is good, inflight entertainment is complete and all of the movies are pretty up to date. Very good selection of movies and entertainment onboard. They also have wifi, notably on the domestic leg, and the Wi-Fi is quite slow, though it is acceptable considering the situation. Seat is comfortable, though the leg room in the Main Cabin is a little too cramped."
1163,10,E175 / A320,Business,Economy Class,Boston to Austin via New York,December 2019,5,5,5,5,5,,5,1,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I don't fly economy often, but to due the holiday, First Class was full. Flew from Boston to Austin via New York in the midst of a massive snow storm. BOS to JFK was delay by 30 minutes, due to ground operations, understandable and not initially an issue as I had a couple hours in JFK before flying onto AUS. We were upgraded to comfort plus due to my status, which provided a little extra leg room, which turned out to be a god send, as the weather caused us to need to de ice, then be number 28th in line for take off due to Logan Airport only having 1 runway in operation, again due to the storm. In short, gate to gate was just over 3 hours, the crew did provide snacks and drinks en route, due to the long delays, which was nice. Had 25 minutes to catch my connection to AUS, thankfully gate was right next door. This time in economy, We had 3 seats together. Take off was about 15 minutes delayed as Delta was attempting to play catch up due to the bad weather further north. Legroom was decent and we purchased a lunch from Delta's flight fuel menu. A really nice sandwich, chips and cookie, with condiments, a napkin and plastic utensil for $11.00. The quality was much better than I expected and I enjoyed my very first Buy on Board experience. Multiple drink rounds and snack offerings en route. Good in flight entertainment, landed on time and my bags were waiting for me at baggage. A really solid level of service."
1164,10,A320,Business,First Class,Austin to Boston via New York,December 2019,5,5,5,5,5,,5,1,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Flew in first 2 days prior to Thanksgiving from AUS to BOS, my 6am Nonstop to Boston had a mechanical issue and flight was delayed 11.5 hours! With a pre holiday crowded flight, as you can imagine, the gate area erupted into chaos. I retreated to the Austin Sky Lounge, which is fantastic to search for other options. The delta App is fine, however, I found more options available via the website. Rerouted to fly AUS to JFK to BOS, First Class to JFK then economy to Bos. My new routing required me to spend 6 hours in the AUS Sky Club, then fly out later that afternoon. AUS SkyClub is the best. Great ambiance, had a hearty Breakfast and lunch, with great food options. Flew First Class to JFK on an A320, plenty comfortable, nice pre departure beverage, once in the air, my 2nd lunch for the day. Delta offer a burger for the hot option. At first I was a little disappointed, but I must say the burger was fresh, hot and tasted great. A nice potato salad, vs a a bag of chips and a another great chocolate dessert. On time into JFK has a couple of hours, thank goodness as I had to change terminals. The Delta inter terminal Jitney Service is pretty quick. The JFK SkyClub, terminal 4 is under renovation, so pretty disappointing and way to crowded, as it was 7pm. A quick 35 minute flight to BOS in economy this time as First Class was booked when I had to change my flights. Exit row was nice, no service due to the short duration, Landed 10 hours past my original arrival time, but hey, things happen. Delta provided 3 of us, 20,000 miles each and a $200 credit voucher for the delay and downgrade on the last flight from JFK to BOS, which I felt was more than fair. I used twitter messenger to contact Delta Customer Service,. They were responsive, empathetic and in short great to deal with. Long Day, but they got me to my destination. This was one day that my Sky Club membership proved invaluable."

If I didn't know better I would believe the flight from Charlotte to Salt Lake left an hour late on purpose. Maybe they were overbooked in Salt Lake but the pilot seemed to be killing time with a lame excuse about some minor issue that didn't really need fixing so we sat there an hour. Then he came back and said he was checking the wings for ice. There was no ice on the wings. Temp was in the 40s but we de iced anyway to kill more time then he taxied aimlessly around the tarmac before 20 more minutes before finally leaving just late enough to miss the connection to Phoenix. I ended up having to hang around for 3 hours to catch the next flight out by only 30 minutes. Will never fly Delta again.

I have had delayed flights with this airline but that happens and I expect as much sometimes. However, when I spend more money for a comfort+ ticket so my boyfriend and I can travel home more comfortably after the holiday, I also expect as much. I did not read anywhere that our seats may not have entertainment screens in front of them. I feel as though Delta made no effort in informing me as a customer about this possibility and my overall very positive image of Delta has now been tainted. I do not recommend comfort+ unless you're willing to risk losing hours of entertainment (flight distractions) for more leg room. Incredibly disappointed in what was my favorite airline."

I have Global Entry and Clear, so TSA Precheck always shows on my boarding pass whenever I've flown with Delta. Except for this time. This is saved to my Delta profile and always shows on my boarding pass when I've flown before, and when I've flown with other airlines. But not during the busiest travel weekend. And the ticket agents act bored and surely, and shrug there's nothing they can do. So don't count on your security status when flying Delta. Delta, thanks for nothing."

I didn't know I had messed up until I was being dropped off at the airport as I had forgotten my phone and had to drive back to pick it up at my house. Anyway, I do not fly much, I don't own a credit card (I am an unpaid family caretaker) as I cant afford bills. The money I had in my bank account is what I had including tbe cash in my wallet. Anyway, the assistant at the service desk I encountered was empathic, non-judgmental, caring and real. I unfortunately forgot the gals name, so sorry. Just kind of how may day is going. As once I was at the boarding gate I opened a soda and it sprayed all over me and everything. The person two chairs away acted like he didn't see it happen.. I know that the Delta employee, had she been there, would have offered to help. "

1172,3,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Orlando,November 2019,3,1,5,5,4,2,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Los Angeles to Orlando. I was on a Delta flight back home from Los Angeles after my grandfather passed. I payed a lot of money because this was a last min trip. I was traveling with my 4 month old baby girl. I had to change her diaper asap. I was closer to the front and they were giving out snacks and drinks at the back so I could not really go through to the back. So when I was heading to the front bathroom, the male flight attendant told we to wait aside (with his hand) so I waited, one person came out the bathroom, as soon as that happens another person from first class goes in and he sees her. She comes out, a second person gets up and goes into the bathroom, ( I can’t get to the bathroom fast enough as he made me wait behind the first class section) then a third first class person goes in front of me. At that point I’m getting upset because this flight attendant knows I’ve been waiting there - then I ask if the changing table is located in side the bathroom, I’ve never changed a diaper in an airplane before so I don’t know. He replies by telling me “I suppose“ But because I’m not first class he doesn’t nothing to help, and he was Very nice to the first class so I can see he’s got potential to be nice to me as well if I would of paid extra for first class. I finally was able to get to the bathroom to change my baby. 2 hrs later, I had to use the restroom. Again, I have to go to the front. Then I ask him if it’s being used. He reply’s with “I don’t know, what do you see the sign say”? With a very rude attitude. He was just over all a very rude flight attendant. I’ve been in many many flights and I’ve never been treated like a peasant. I guess I can expect this from spirit, frontier , or American, but Not United. I just rather fly the other airlines, it’s not worth the money they charge if they won’t treat you nice."

Denver to Atlanta. My flight was supposed to take off at 1:19 pm, we all boarded and the second I put my butt on the uncomfortable no leg room seat, they made us deplane. The pilot said it would be two hours, the kiosk lady said it would be 20 minutes, we kept hearing confusing details. We took off after 3 pm, almost 2 hours late because of a hydraulic problem, whatever that means. To top it off, there was no food! Because they couldn’t tell us when we would board, everyone sat on the floor in the terminal waiting, so we couldn’t go get food, and the flight had no food. I missed my connecting flight, the flight attendants were rude, they had no food."
1175,10,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Frankfurt via New York,October 2019,5,5,5,4,5,,5,1,Not Verified ,"  On our trip from Boston to Frankfurt we had to change planes in NY. We went from La Guardia to JFK, where we had to pass through security again. About 30 minutes before boarding I realized that my passport was not there anymore. I went to the Delta counter where a very friendly and efficient lady explained to me that without my passport I would not be allowed to travel. She recommended that I or my wife should go all the way back to security where they have their own lost and found. To cut a long story short: My wife went there and the passport had been found. Back at the counter we were told that boarding had been closed and that it was impossible for us to get on that plane. And then the miracle happened: the agent organized everything for us. She put us on the same flight 24 hours later, booked a hotel room for us, breakfast, taxi - all we needed. And it didn´t cost us a dollar. All this was paid for by Delta. Our nightmare had turned into a wonderful experience of excellent service, kindness and understanding. They would not have to do this as it was our own fault, after all. We are more than grateful to Elizabeth. A wonderful lady and a great airline! "
1176,10,A330-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Detroit ,November 2019,5,5,4,4,5,,5,1,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Amsterdam to Detroit . If Delta is intent on becoming a 4-star airline, I hope they get there soon. I never thought I would live to say this, but after my two experiences with Delta international new service, I am going to actually search Delta tickets over most European airlines, and reasons for that are many and concern the basic comforts required to be able to sustain flying long hours in a metal canister. We were positively shocked to receive a welcoming cocktail - in basic economy - and one of our favorite cocktails, peach Bellini. The cabin crew ran rounds with water and soft drinks, and also several rounds with hot drinks and alcohol. The wine is not bad at all. They give hot towels before meals. Food has been improved, too, and the white grape, cheese and toasted almond snack was delish, as was the salted caramel ice cream. The pizza twist served as a second snack was underwhelming, however, but pizza is not my favorite anyway. Nothing to object to cabin crew or pilots, they are up to the task, as they always have been, but the service and the little things that make up the 9 hours on the plane bearable, are much better. The flight was super smooth and we touched down on time. Finally, big thanx to the Delta ground crew at Amsterdam, who on their own initiative assigned us much better seats than the online system allowed us to reserve during online check-in. Much thanks, we enjoyed our seats."

Not only was my flight delayed (4) times but then when I got to my gate, I was told that the flight was to a different city. The customer service rep was rude when I showed him the discrepancy and told me to just sit down and wait for my flight. My father had heart surgery and a stroke shortly after the surgery and I really needed to be there. Thanks to the lack of organization and professionalism, I was not able to be present and am still waiting on my connecting flight info because apparently that is also incorrect."

First, there was nothing first class about this flight. I was offered a soft drink, coffee or other types of standard economy class drink before takeoff, In flight, I was offered the same drink with a snack of either nuts, cheez its, and other varieties like that. No meal service, not even a sandwich was offered. A friend of mine in economy had the same snack we had, in fact, he was given 3 bags of cheez its. The seat was roomy but not real clean, there were shoe scuffs on the bulkhead in front of me and the seat belt had seen better days, no in-flight entertainment although there was WIFI. This plane was in desperate need of refurbishment and upgrade. The only reason I upgraded to first class was that I had knee surgery a couple of weeks before the flight."

Delta didn’t even send me an email to let me know what was happening, it didn’t update my flight on the app. I spent the whole night at the airport because Delta didn’t give me any hotel or something like that. Such a poor service, Delta are so irresponsible with your clients. I wouldn’t recommend at all. I called the Delta attendant and he didn’t even find my confirmation system. He wanted to put me on a flight for 24 hours later. Was he kidding?"

Being a traveling musician needed to take my guitar. Typically there is closet space but in this case was told guitar needed pink tag to go under plane. While the crew assured me my guitar ($1000 Martin) would be in good hands it was severely cracked when I got home. Claim was denied with poor service. They did offer very minute repair fee after I complained again. Not nearly enough to cover my guitar which is needed for living. Also flight was delayed and there was no flow to boarding process. Being a gold member and spending thousands throughout the years one would think there would be better respect. So all in all Delta pretends to be good service until you need them most.

I have used Delta for many years, however my last (4) trips flown with the company has been hindered with issue after issue. Though I have tried to reconcile these issues with the company and have been gifted several vouchers (which i have not used) it seems that the issues mentioned do not get corrected. My last flight was Nov. 10, 2019 flying home from spending my birthday with friends and family. the flight was set to board at 7:35pm and depart at 8:15pm. At the gate it was announced that the airline was awaiting the arrival of the captain and co-captain to arrive and boarding was pushed back 20-30 minutes. This is understandable ... boarding started at or around 8:10pm whereas it was around 8:30 by the time Main Cabin 1 was called to board. Around 20 minutes after sitting in my seat the flight attendants cam over the PA stating that they had no update on the whereabouts of the captain and co- captain and thanked everyone for their patience (8:50pm). 20 minutes later the Captain announced his sincerest apologies and explained he had just flown in with the NFL team and had been stranded on the tarmac for some time before catching a ride over to our plane (9:10pm). He added that checks still had to be made prior to the flight and we should be taking off in around 25-30 minutes. At 9:34 pm we pushed away from the gate prepared for take off and that the flight would take two hours and fourteen minutes from take off to touch down, then another delay as we were declared number 3 for take off. The flight landed in Orlando after midnight however by the time we were able to exit the plane was more closer to 1am. We had prepaid parking set for 11pm retrieval. At 1:15am we picked up our vehicle and started our hour and fifteen minute drive home (2:30am). We both had to work in the early morning, myself at 5:00 am. Delta's form of understanding how much adverse effects can have for having such poor service... $75.00! This is the gratitude the company feels is adequate for its customers."

Due to poor road conditions, no drivers were willing to take me to the airport for my early morning flight despite trying Lyft, Uber, and calling every taxi company in the area from 4 AM until after 6 AM. When someone was finally willing to take me, it was too late and I missed my flight. Upon I arriving at the airport, I told a customer service agent I missed my flight and don't know what to do, and she immediately was very kind and comforting. She directed me to a desk and reassured me it would be sorted out. The agent at the desk was extremely compassionate, and despite the fact that I had only paid for an economy fare ticket and did not purchase the flexible fare, he did not charge me for changing my flight and got me a seat on the next plane. He also kindly reassured me that everything would be fine and I would be able to get home. I was the last one to board the plane and it departed right away. I am so thankful that they waited for me and that they were so kind as to not charge me again. They were within their rights to charge me again, but they treated me kindly like a person rather than just another source of profit. Great service, friendly and kind agents, big fan of their in-flight entertainment system as well as the free wi-fi for in-flight messaging purposes. I also like that they still give both cookies and crackers on the short flights, whereas other airlines I've flown with only offer beverages now. The only downside is the seat cushions are not well padded in economy, but you get what you pay for. I have rarely flown with Delta in the past, but I would definitely fly with them again."

I have been a Delta platinum member for years and Delta has lost my bag and is not doing anything about it. I arrived at JFK from Accra, retrieved my 3 suitcases and re-checked them in to Tampa only for me to receive just 2 bags in Tampa. Customer service has been useless on how to handle the situation and no one calls back when they say they will. I’ve had to go to the airport every day for 2 weeks straight and also sent someone in JFK to go to Delta baggage services personally only for them not to be able to help. I ended up having to file a claim and Delta is asking for receipts of all my stuff in the bag-which is ridiculous because how do they expect me to have receipts for items purchased years ago? Did I ask for my bag to be lost? The claims manager never answers his phone or returns messages. This is so unacceptable and I’ve had enough of this nonsense. I paid so much for my ticket-not to mention all my valuables inside the suitcase which Delta compensate me for. I need my bag back and Delta at this point feels they can be careless and pay me off (which they cannot because they would give me way less than what everything costs) and get away with it. Me and my family have only flown Delta for so many years but I will probably have to switch to a different airline now because I am so disappointed."

Of the 4 total flights, 3 of them left right on time and got me to my destinations early. The fourth flight (Seattle to SJC) ended up getting delayed about 2 hours. However, in addition to courtesy texts and emails informing me of the delay and apologizing, they apologized to all of us again at the gate about an hour out from boarding and offered all of us free snacks and drinks. Delays are a reality of air travel, but my experience with Delta showed me that they work hard to avoid delays and even harder to make up for them if they occur. Things like free snacks may be a small gesture, but they really go a long way in showing they care. Great experience overall."

My flights are booked far out using a 3rd party vendor. I request seat selections based upon availability at the booking time, but I always end up in the middle on super lengthy flights. Then, because I travel with a smaller carry-on bag, I'm expected to put it under my seat. I'm in the middle, I don't have arm space or leg room by the time, I slide the bag under the seat. Military probably gets discounted rates which is why Delta probably doesn't take seat selection into consideration. It's business travel, and it absolutely sucks with Delta. Anytime I can fly American, I will."

I would discourage anyone needing to get to their destination on the same day as promised when purchasing tickets to avoid Delta. Delta claimed ""bad weather"" as a reason they could not land in Atlanta. However, our connecting flight took off during this extended period of 'bad weather.' They also lied about rebooking us on the next available flight. They also lied about having customer service representatives available at the gate upon arrival. They prevented a wedding party from attending the rehearsal for a destination wedding. If your travel plans matter to you, don't choose Delta."

And they seem to be larger than might work. When you are in the comfort+ and you board when you should you would expect to be able to have overhead space for a cpap machine. I put my backpack in the seat in front of me. This wasn’t the case it had to be put all the way in the back. I think you should be addressing the carry one issue.

As I type this I am sitting in yet another aircraft with a mechanical issue and the mechanic won’t be here for at least a half hour. Flights constantly delayed or cancelled. Funny though, if I opt for American Airlines, I don’t seem to have these issues. Very frustrating after all the money I’ve spent with these folks. Although not as convenient, I’m making the switch to American after today."
1202,1,,Business,Economy Class,Singapore to Tokyo,September 2019,1,3,2,2,1,3,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Delta repeatedly has bad ground and customer service staff. The breaking point which compelled me to write a feedback on this airline after flying with them for so many years came when they did not handle my luggage professionally. When there was damages found on the bags, the ground agents denied liabilities and accuse the fault was on passengers. The same was true to other passengers who experienced the same problem on the same flight when in Singapore from the US via Tokyo. After filing complaint to the customer service, the customer service took more than 14 days to reply (when in their auto reply email stated they would reply within 14 days) and the customer service would defend their mistakes and continue laying blame on the passengers. I have been their top level frequent fliers but I never felt I was treated like one at all. They don't offer any preferential check in, retrieval of luggage bags above their usual sky priority which a simple comfort + would earn the similar treatment while being the top frequent fliers on other alliance group or airlines would have offered 1st class service than Delta offering merely the same like comfort +. Service recovery is bad. The staff are not trained or geared towards high value customers at all. Having a Porsche for tight connection is nothing premium when other airlines offer direct boarding from lounge like Emirates or complimentary limousine airport transfers such as from JL, MH and so on. They appear to prefer paid business class passengers but their products and services completely do NOT match up to any full service airlines that have business class product. Their lounge is always filled with so many people and refreshment are really just plain refreshment (basic snacks NOT food) and very often, their lounges do NOT even have shower facilities. So don't even count on having complimentary spa/massage/sleeping area etc. Their planes are dirty and old yet the ticket fares are expensive. Amenities frequently not working for example IFE doesn't work, USB not charging, food stuck in between seats, chewing gums found in aircraft safety menu, dirty toilets, broken window shades and Delta has a policy where instead of bumping revenue passengers to higher classes when seats are needed, they would instead bump their non revenue employees or families/kins onto business class seats especially on international route. Their complimentary first class upgrade almost hardly happen to any members as it will always be full. Delta will always try not to offer the upgrade until at boarding and by which time, all the first class seats would be taken up already. So don't be fooled by the benefits stated on their website for their frequent fliers programme. Their hidden clause to defend their misrepresentation would be ""whenever available"". To Delta, available for revenue tickets doesn't mean available for upgrade. There is absolutely no incentives being their frequent fliers especially for international travellers. They are just a commuter airline within US or regional at best. So Delta best if ever rated best is best within the US only. In one word to describe Delta and by International Standard, avoid  it. Its better to take your money to other airlines who would respect and treat premium or frequent fliers more seriously."

We had connecting flights both departing and returning back to New Jersey from Munich. Everything ran smoothly. We did have to retrieve our baggage on our return flight because of international customs but Delta had an place in the Detroit departure area to drop off luggage and forward them to Newark. It was effortless. The flight attendants made the time on both flights remarkably comfortable. Blankets and pillows were available. They were attentive to our needs. Warm moist cloths were given before our 2 meals to freshen up. Beverages were served several times and cups of water offered frequently. Snacks were served and offered when we wanted, the flight attendants seemed to truly enjoy their job. The captains let us know what was going on especially when we had a weather delay flying back to Newark. It was nice to hear why we were being held back from landing and for how long instead of wondering what was happening or how long we would be circling. We will not hesitate to choose Delta/KLM in the future. As stressful as flying can be the Delta crew made it an amazing journey. "

They had pillows and blankets and little televisions in the seats and you can track your flight. The pilot kept us updated. I literally will only fly Delta from now on. On our way home we flew Alaska and I was extremely upset that it was such a downgrade. I was shivering and freezing cold the entire flight as was my son and husband and we were in long sleeves and pants. No pillows, no blankets, you had to pay to use the tablets, staff were snotty.

I have decided to fly with another airline going forward just because my overall experience with Delta is simply too frustrating. I was also pretty unhappy with the unreasonable 1st checked baggage fee. Also my not being able to choose my seat during check-in. And when I asked the agent to change it for me in Frankfurt he simply had no interest in helping me. Food was also unsatisfactory. My opinion at this point is that Delta is simply not worth the headache. FYI: the changes Delta has made are clearly not geared toward passenger satisfaction.

Then they changed our terminal to the furthest terminal to have to run and catch our plane to Costa Rica. Never mind the people who didn't listen to the announcement of please sit if you do not have a connecting flight in less than an hour. Now we are out 8 hours of our destination and 200 dollars to have to taxi from another town we are flying into. I will not book flight with Delta again.

It seems they could do it more efficiently but would rather annoy everyone. There’s never enough room to put your carry on because they don’t enforce carry on size. One suitcase will fill an overhead bin where three carry ons should go. I had to sit with my legs crossed in my seat for my whole flight - very uncomfortable. The staff on the flight is not  courteous or helpful. And who thinks some wheat cheezits are good? Very disappointed. It’s like each flight gets worse and worse. It’s almost worth taking your chances of getting pulled out of your seat and just going with another airline.

While sitting for about 30 minutes the stated they was looking into some things & would update shortly. It was after 7 before they came advising we had to get off the plane, it couldn't fly because of navigation that our flight would leave at 9. While sitting & waiting the pilot comes on to say sorry folks I can't fly you out at 9 that he would reach his 20 hours so trying to round up a crew to fly out at 1:20. Everyone all upset so they start putting people in hotels & getting a taxi. The guy in front of me got the last room available so only other recourse would be pay out of pocket ourselves. I advised that I had an event that morning in Bryon at 11am was there any other flights so I was eventually able to grab a standby. My ticket says wheelchair assistance because I cant do all of the walking in the airport due to disability. So I get to Atlanta airport no wheelchair & to top things off my baggage with all my things I needed was no where to be found. I fill out a baggage claim. Saturday evening my baggage was delivered. I submit a complaint online thru Delta to get a response by email saying they was sorry & unfortunately couldn't assist. My thought process is after everything I had been thru for an airline to not think enough to at least pick up the phone to call your customer was just as bad as the entire experience on Friday. Unbelievable Delta, really unbelievable! Not to mention the entire time sitting on the plane did you offer crackers or juice will everyone sitting there cramped up & uncomfortable."
1216,3,Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Detroit ,September 2019,2,3,3,2,1,1,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Amsterdam to Detroit, 26 September 2019 Premium Select. Check-in on line impossible, stating that a change had occurred and that I was allowed to amend my flight at no extra cost. Not a real option as the rest of the trip had already been booked and partially paid for. Arriving at the check-in counter at Amsterdam Airport we got different seats than booked. Explanation: Delta had flown in with a different aircraft. But we were assured that we would nonetheless have Comfort Plus seats being ‘the equivalent of Premium Select’. This is, of course, not the case: The difference between Comfort Plus and Premium Select is 4 inches of legroom less, no leg support and no 7 degrees more reclining seats; a smaller screen and no personalized service etc. Features reflected in the price difference. The big blow, however, came inside the plane. One can try to call any seat a Comfort Plus seat, but not a main cabin seat with 9 instead of 8 abreast. Also, dinner came on the same tray and with the same quality as the rest of the cabin, The menu circulated in advance was clearly marked ‘International Main Cabin’. Checking the safety instructions in the seat pocket, it turned out that the plane in question was a Boeing 777-200 in a configuration not available on Delta’s web site. Probably an older version, because my table was hanging toward me, making my food tray almost landing on my lap. What I reproach Delta most of all is that they were not straightforward. A plane replacement might happen. In that case it would have been correct to let Premium Select passengers know, with excuses and an offer to compensate for the inconvenience. This has not happened."

I was so worried I wouldn't make it but the flight attendant on the flight coming into Atlanta assured me they would wait for me, but I still ran my heart out to the next gate. They had just called for last boarding call and the plane was still there. I explained i had no baggage and am military and really needed to board three plane. It was 2124 and the plane was scheduled to depart at 2131. The lady told me she hears the ""military excuse"" but there's nothing to be done. I understand there is a schedule but this was the last flight into Fayetteville. Every other airline, like southwest, will hold the plane for a small amount of time for passengers with small delays. Delta ruined my chance of getting home before work and I will rethink flying with them again. I want a company that supports thir passengers, especially when that company is the cause of the delay."

We bring it with us for the first time and while checking our bag the lady behind the counter literally threw our luggage and bounced it off the wall and onto the conveyor belt. We mention that was rude and she apologizes. Then we get to our destination and our bag isn’t there to greet us. Great. Glad that’s the second time in a row we have been without our luggage in 2 trips. Delta batting 1000 right there. Fast forward 2 days we get our bag to the airport and the baggage guy in Phoenix is a little more careful with our bag but not much. We get home finally and our zipper is destroyed, our name tag is completely ripped and the  new bag is scratched. Naturally, we decide to speak to a Delta representative at this point and he informs me it’s minor damage and that it’s probably not worth my time to make a claim since Delta surely won’t do anything about it anyways.

Understandably they canceled flights for Saturday October 12th due to a typhoon, but our flight was the following afternoon - all Delta flights on Sunday and Monday are canceled despite the fact that the typhoon has passed by Sunday morning and the majority of other airlines are flying this afternoon and tomorrow. Instead of compensating us for the extra 3 days we are stranded in Tokyo or adding additional flights they are absolving themselves of any blame and forcing their customers to pay over $500 out of pocket for the multiple days we are stranded in Japan. You’re a multi billion dollar corporation and you can’t even offer your customers some kind of compensation when you made a mistake and canceled flights far too early? It’s disappointing but enlightening because it showed me the type of airline you are and you’ll never get another dollar from me."

My flight landed at 830pm at ATL so I could hit a connecting flight at 9:07. We weren't able to unload because another plane was at the gate we were suppose to pull into. Instead of pulling into a different gate, we sat there for 20 minutes. We finally got to a gate and it wasn't until 9PM that the first person was able to get off the flight. They promised that nobody would miss their connecting flights. Turns out they did not do anything to prevent this. My flight to BMI took off at 9:02PM (suppose to be 9:07PM). I got to the gate at 9:09PM with no plane in sight. There were countless other people who had missed flights due to this airline. The best part was it was a gorgeous day out so it was really just their lack of commitment, maintenance, and planning by the airport. I wish I could create a work environment where I just have to say, ""I'm sorry for not being able to achieve what I said would happen but here are the reasons"". I ended up sleeping at the airport as I imagined I'd get less than 8 hours of sleep if I went to their ""discounted"" hotel (not free), go through security at a big airport, and weave my way around of a mass amount of people to get to my gate. Summary is I missed my grandma's funereal because a company can't uphold it's scheduling. The good news is they got me there eventually, got me a ticket to the next flight, and I was able to see my family. Please never put your faith in this company. Always make sure there's another flight after and if there is, understand that you still might not get onto that flight because it was all already booked. Always look at the airport's policy on missed flights. You'll be amazed at what they can get away with when compared to EU flights."

They told me I had to buy a whole other ticket ($200). I couldn’t take the meeting from the airport because my computer died and I needed my charger which I left at home on accident, besides I didn’t think I would need it. I was already having a bad day and Delta made it worse with their bad customer service. They told me that purchasing another ticket was all I could do, but then after pleading with the customer service rep they told me I could stand on standby and pay an additional fee if there were additional seats on the plane. If they said that first, this all could have been avoided. $75 charge for stand-buy, on my top of the $170 ticket."

The plane landed on time. I cannot comment on IFE or food as i did not get to view and eat them respectively.

Lining up to get checked in at one of the economy counters, the Delta worker told us to go to the premium check-in counters on the other side which had far fewer people. The lady at the counter processed us quickly and we were making our way to the security line. So, that was a good start to our journey back to Seattle. The flight left on time and as it departed late afternoon, I got to eat a meal on Delta and it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. It was average quality airline food. The IFE was reasonable for a domestic route. The typical reviews I read of US-based airlines mention how terrible the flight attendants are. However, the flight crew on this flight was professional and courteous. So, I thought I was fortunate to get a good crew. Upon reading little more on the US based airlines, it seems Delta has a better operation and more motivated workforce than American or United. Well, I hope they keep improving as all of them have a long way to go to compete effectively with many of the Middle Eastern and Asian airlines. If it wasn't for the US government protecting the domestic market for these carriers from their overseas competitors, they would have stopped operating long time before they went through their multi-year bankruptcy. Sorry, I am digressing from the flight experience. Overall, I enjoyed the flight back to Seattle and the experience was better than I expected.

There were at least 5 other passengers on the flight scheduled for the same connecting flight to Columbus. By the time we got off the plane we had 20 min to get across the airport to make our flight. We told all the Delta employees on our flight and at the arrival gate to communicate to the other gate that we were coming. One other passenger even called in to Delta. We got there 5 min before the actual departure time, and they hadn’t held the plane. They left without all of us! The departing gate employees claimed they never received any kind of info from the other gate. Finally we were forced to get rebooked for another flight, the service desk ladies were extremely slow, uncooperative, and rude. The soonest Delta could get us to our destination was 6 hours after our initial scheduled arrival. The service was terrible. No one was helpful. No vouchers were offered or any kind of effort to make things better. We almost missed the back up plan flights because they took so long to get our flights changed."

I was quite satisfied with Delta, especially during my return trip. Even though I flew the Basic Economy, they put me in decent seats. The seats were not the most comfortable, but the legroom wasn’t terrible. The onboard entertainment was wonderful with a decent variety of shows and movies. Both ground service and flight attendants were all friendly. The SEA to DEN flight did the standard drink service, but also came around two additional times: one for coffee and one for water. Overall, I was satisfied with their service and amenities. I will consider Delta for future trips."

Los Angeles to Boston round trip Delta One Boeing 757. All 3 experiences were great. Honolulu LA was an internationally configured 767 so the seat was amazing The food was perfectly good above average domestic first class. LA to Boston round trip was an internationally configured 757 with Delta One service. While the layout on the 767 allowed for me to sit alone, the food etc was not quite as good as the Delta One flights. The Delta One 757 offered very comfortable 2x2 seating with upgraded service such as amenity kits..etc. On all flights the attendants were friendly and terrific, the entertainment plentiful and the experiences were all excellent. Delta One is a gigantic step up from Delta first domestic which can feel very cramped. These flights were all great."
1236,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Lihue, Hawaii to Los Angeles",September 2019,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," I am beyond shocked at how disappointed I am in my experience(s) with my recent Delta flights. I have tried calling the corporate line 3 times and no answer. I sent them a complaint requesting a call back, nothing. So now I’ll share my experience with everyone I can. Our flight returning home from Hawaii was delayed 5 hours by the time we took off. It didn’t leave until after 2am when all was said and done. We had no where to go as everything closes early in Kauai, extra expenses related to rental car late return, had more expenses due to staying longer (food), had to try to make arrangements for kids that were supposed to be dropped off at our house by a certain time, and most importantly wasted my time and caused a lot of unneeded stress. I think of experiences I have had with companies in the past and this one far surpasses any negative experience I have had in the past. I called when we realized it was delayed, which was further delayed once more. I got a CS person that really was not helpful at all. They offered $100 for my troubles. I asked for a manager and he told me that is all they could do. Got the manager and she mentioned they might be able to do a bit more and never recorded the call or offer. I was so frustrated that my friends I was traveling with decided to call as I was getting really frustrated. My screen did not work on the way to Hawaii. My wife’s screen did not work on the way back. I cannot believe the lack of customer support. Any business I can think of that I have had a negative experience with has tried to rectify the negative experience. I feel you have to beg for help with Delta. I personally feel Delta does not care about its customers. A follow up call or apology coming from Delta would have been highly appropriate. Frankly if I had this type of experience at my business we’d bend over backwards to make it right. Delta has not done squat! I think they figure they’re big enough it really doesn’t matter. Hopefully my feedback online everywhere I can think of will make a difference? Highly unlikely I think!"

Just after take-off all of the passengers in premium and economy got complimentary breakfast, the sausage was a little cold but the scrambled eggs were great. About 50 minutes before landing into Seattle, me and the FO started talking in the front galley about planes and general aviation, it was great.

The worst experience I have had on a flight ever. We came 3 hours early and was forced to check in our carry on bags as some other passengers used our storage. The seat I was given had a broken seat belt and I was not checked on so at all so that was a safety hazard. The nightmare started when the flight was delayed. They were boarding groups 1 and 2 but a bunch of people who were from group 3 cut in and nobody checked. Our group followed the rules by waiting for the group we were assigned and it was a big mistake! All the storage was taken so we were forced to check our carry on bags. Staff were also very unorganized, unprofessional and never apologized. One of them at the front desk told me ""you can wait for another later flight but it was already 11pm"" when I had commented about our situation which was rude and made the situation worse. Then when we sat my seat belt was broken and no one checked. Then the flight attendant completely skipped our row for drinks and ignored us. After an hour of waiting and being patient for the hope that one flight attendant would notice my husband hit the button to calmly explain that we were skipped for drinks. We never received any apology for anyone and were treated as second class passengers. I always believed that Delta airlines had an exceptional reputation with excellent customer service but my opinion has now changed. Our experience after paying nearly $600 was not of an airline with high standards instead it felt like a cheap discount airline like Spirit or Frontier with terrible customer service. So sad and never again we will try to fly with you we will go with American or United the next time we travel."

When did Delta Airlines become such a bad company? Checked in exactly 24 hours before my flights from FLL-ATL-BOG but only got one seat assignment. Called DL and they told me it was because I'd ""chosen"" a long connexion (their website offered it to me). I pointed out that in IATA area one a connexion is 12 hours so why did it not check me in for my connexion? No useful response. Was told to check-in again 24 hours before connexion flight. I did so and got a seat assignment but no boarding pass. Asked at counter at FLL and was told again it was due to long connexion time and that I should just check-in a fourth time at the gate. I did so and registered my dissatisfaction at having to check-in four times and this unpleasant woman said there was no reason why I shouldn't have been given a boarding pass in Atlanta when I asked for one. Delta advertised a dinner on the flight from ATL-BOG but it was a cold snack (turkey sandwich, two apple slices, and a small chunk of chocolate). To list this as a dinner  flight you must serve a hot meal. This is false advertising. In-flight entertainment was good. The cabin crew never broke into a smile not even a ""Pan-Am Smile."" The flight was very cheap though so I guess I paid a Spirit Airlines fare so I got Spirit Airlines service. A note to US carriers: we Americans have bony bums so need a cushion to sit on -- your seats feel like you're sitting on a wooden board."

I travel 30-40 times a year and have delays 30% of the time on Delta. What's annoying is the constant lying. Tell us you don't know rather than delay 5 times.

1243,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bismark to Minneapolis,September 2019,,,,,,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  About a week ago I decided to book a one-way flight with Delta out of Bismark to Minneapolis. Unfortunately, they were one of two airlines flying from there. Everything was going well and I purchased my ticket with a ""24 Hour Refund Guarantee."" What is very misleading about this is that the airline does not specify which 24 hours these are. You can only get a refund within 24 hours of purchasing the ticket, not before the flight takes place. So with this assumption that the flight could be canceled and refunded as long as there was a 24 hour in advance notice, I booked the ticket. Unfortunately for me, issues arose I can no longer take this flight. I tried to cancel the flight online, which I did, trying to get my refund, which I didn't. I then tried to call and get my refund, only to be informed that there is a $200 fee for canceling my flight, and I would only get back what the ticket was worth minus that, a whopping $18 (which can only be used towards another flight). This is at two-plus months away from the flight, there is plenty of time for them to find a replacement for my seat. After sitting on hold for thirty minutes waiting for a representative, I was once again told there would be no refund, so I asked them to reinstate my ticket. There was no way I was going to allow this company to get double the profit off of my seat, I'd rather it stay empty. I then asked them if the ticket could be transferred to another person, so I could get someone to purchase the ticket from me. The answer is no. Not only that, but the representative on the phone sounded just as frustrated as I was. Lesson learned: I have to click two or three different links to learn what exactly what a ""24 Hour Refund Guarantee"" is. On top of that, I should know not to trust what a big company shows at face value. Even if for some odd reason I would get the chance to take this flight, I wouldn't. I will never fly with Delta if I can avoid it. I wish I would have done my research in advance, or I would have seen all the bad reviews they had."

The staff on the ground was mostly friendly and onboard very friendly. Decent meals, enough drinks, and very attentive staff. I particularly like the 767-300 for the 2-3-2 seat configuration. While it is an older plane (around 30 years old), the seat configuration has always been a plus. Would fly again."

I had a flight from Portland to Phoenix via Seattle. They had no room on the flight for luggage, so they had me check my carryon. I asked the flight attendant, “can I get my carry on in SEA? I need my laptop.” She said, “absolutely! You can get it at the sky bridge with your ticket.” Then it’s time to connect and they overbooked the flight (per usual). I stay in Seattle because I have business here. so I ask them to go get the bag they promised me. Fiona at the counter was great and went to get my bag. She tells me I can pick it up at the baggage claim. I go there and find it in the company of the least friendly of all Delta employees. Finally, (I think) we’re reunited! Not so fast. The chick at the counter proceeds to tell me they are not allowed to short check bags and I cannot collect my bag. Naturally, she says this 2-3 times before I beg her to give me a solution. She tells me to proceed to ticketing so i can buy a new ticket to Seattle and collect my bag there. When I get to ticketing, I explain my story for the 3rd time. She explains that she needs to call global before permitting my bag return. So she calls global and insists I pay a fee to collect my bag. 45 minutes later and extra $$$ I have my carry on. Had any of the employees explained there may be an extra fee or a ridiculous process I may not have been so fuming mad. But they didn’t, nor did they have any compassion on my situation that was ultimately their problem. To be honest, I will go out of my way to never fly Delta again."

We were incredibly disappointed with our Delta experience. On 9/2/19, we were scheduled to take DELTA 322 from Dallas to LaGuardia, our flight was delayed prior to take off but was supposed to arrive on time, however, we were rerouted to Norfolk right before landing in NYC. We eventually made it to LaGuardia but missed our connecting flight to BTV. The next flight out of LaGuardia was around 9:30pm on 9/3/19 which was not acceptable. We spoke to an agent who found a flight out of JFK (DELTA 5120) leaving at 12:15pm on 9/3/19. When we arrived at LaGuardia, we sought out a Delta representative and explained our situation, he gave us a “distressed passenger” voucher for a hotel. We called the number and the only hotel available was the Crown Plaza - we were required to pay $231.85 (which was apparently the discounted rate). We then had to spend $40 on transportation from LaGuardia to JFK at 1am. The receptionist at the Crown Plaza stated that she had never heard of an airline making customers pay for their hotel room due to airline error/delays. We were not the only customers flying with Delta at this hotel who has this issue. Not only did we incur nearly $300 of unexpected/unnecessary expenses but we also lost a day worth of work and animal care fees. We are absolutely unsatisfied with Delta and the way in which this was handled."
1249,3,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Beijing to Seattle,September 2019,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Beijing to Seattle. Delta is flying 15-year-old airliners. That sounds pretty old, and it is. Our seats felt like they had come out of someone's neglected car. On our China-bound flight, we were without the in-flight entertainment system for much of the flight. What was displayed was the ""rebooting"" routine. Once up and running, the entertainment consisted of a dozen, or so, uninteresting movies; along with some very brief documentaries. The music selection consisted of 30 minutes of your chosen genre. On a ten hour flight, 30 minutes of music is a pretty bad plan. On our return flight, ten days later, we were fortunate to have the entertainment up and running during most of the flight, but the entertainment was identical. Both my wife and I ended up watching the same film on both legs of the trip. Food is about as awful as I've seen on any airline. We knew enough to bring lots of our own food with us. Our ""comfort plus"" seating included meals that our boys didn't touch. Less than two hours into the return flight I very politely requested a few cartons of milk for our little ones, and learned that there were none. They apparently had only loaded twenty 4oz cartons of milk onto the plane to provide for 198 passengers for over 10 hours. I actually had three flight attendants show up at my seat to scold me, saying ""We're not 7-Eleven."" In my decades of flying, this was the first time that I was actually scolded after politely requesting a carton of milk! We chose Delta because of a very different experience than we had with the airline about six years ago. This will be our last time with Delta."

Delta is not committed to passenger safety or quality service. Our flight from JFK to Ponta Delgada on 8/8/19 & 8/9/19 was canceled and then delayed for over 24 hours. This was due to an inability to replace crews that had timed out and a failure to do a maintenance check on the aircraft which was flying in the air and then required to return back to the US before entering foreign territory. Delta customer service representative was unapologetic, combative and informed us that Delta engages in the practice of flying aircrafts without proper maintenance checks. They did not wish to compensate passengers in any way other than offering a pathetic amount of skymiles to fly them again. We had to practically threaten to sue to just get a $200 credit yet our costs incurred for transportation, food, lodging and the mental anguish was a greater amount."

But instead, Delta airlines held us on the runway for more than an hour waiting on a single maintenance person to come in and spend literally 2 minutes fixing one of the bathrooms. We waited an entire hour, which made the entire plane which was almost all connections late, for one bathroom to be fixed for a 2 hour flight. The worst service imaginable, now people who were supposed to fly at 10 AM are all being delayed to 3 PM flights, or 5 or even 9. And tomorrow is Labor Day, so some people are actually just stuck here in Atlanta. The worst airline service I’ve ever received, absolutely no urgency or care for the customers.

Delta actually has a pretty good product once you're on the plane. Seats are comfortable, they have TVs, and the snacks are pretty good. Flight attendants are hit or miss, my first flight had surly ones, while on the second flight they were outstanding. But the ground experience is where Delta fails miserably. They now board international flights 50 minutes early, so I got a series of urgent texts and phone notifications telling me to go to my gate immediately, which stressed me out because my connecting flight was late and I was a terminal away. I rushed to get on the plane only to sit there for another half hour while waiting for all the other connecting passengers to come. I really resented being put in that position of stress when it wasn't necessary, and recommend that Delta put its boarding times later to give connecting passengers time to get there."

When I asked if my husband’s seat was also changed I was told it was not. When I said that was not acceptable (which I thought was obvious) I was told we could sit together in 7A and 7B. The problem was they failed to tell that to the person in 7B who was already on the plane. After attempting to get into 7A (a window seat) with minimal success, I sat in my original seat. At that point I was told I was in the wrong seat. When I explained the situation I was told I had been moved to accommodate other passengers who wished to sit together. Not OK. I have contacted Delta and am awaiting a response as to why they believe they have the right to discriminate against others in a country where that is illegal."

We are so ecstatic that this was the airline we were switched to and that we were diverted through Atlanta. Every single staff member was understanding of the pressure we felt to get to New York in time to see our Broadway show. I don't know if Delta will read this but Matilda at gate T3 on August 23 for the 130pm flight to New York deserves recognition. When we approached her to get information about our now delayed 230pm flight she knew we wouldn't make it in time for our show so she sent us to customer service where they put us as a priority on the stand by list for the 130pm flight which was on time no questions asked. When we got called to get our seats Matilda recognized us and celebrated with us that we were going to make our show. We were glad to have any seat but we were seated in economy plus (it feels like this was a gift from Matilda). When we left Toronto we felt defeated that we had lost a day and a half of our trip and getting to our Broadway show wasn't guaranteed not to mention we were met with horrible customer service.

1261,2,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Detroit,August 2019,4,4,3,3,2,3,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Denver to Detroit. Our friends always told us we needed to try the nicer airlines out, but we generally couldn’t afford it so we were excited when we found that Delta had a basic economy flight available for a trip home to visit my family. We though “Finally! We get to fly with an airline that treats their customers well!” Boy were we in for a surprise. I guess you only qualify for Deltas better treatment if you have the money to fly in one of their other classes. Just like everything else in this world, it seems Delta has subscribed to the idea that if you don’t have money, you are worthless and don’t deserve to be treated well. Through a course of events, my husband and I were unable to make our departure flight. When we realized we would not make our flight, I called to discuss what could be done. A Delta representative informed me that because I was a basic economy customer, they could not assist me over the phone, so when we arrived at the airport, we spoke with someone at the counter. The representative we spoke with was very condescending and entirely unhelpful. After scolding us for missing our original flight, they informed us that we would need to rebook and that the cost would be over $300 per passenger. Nowhere in that conversation did they indicate that we would need to rebook our entire trip. Not wanting to spend $600+ on top of what we had already spent, we booked a one-way trip with our usual economy airline. We thought our troubles were over. Sure, we were out a couple hundred dollars, but we made it to family vacation and we had a flight home .. or so we thought... We spent a great week with my family and returned to the airport for our flight back home only to find that our entire reservation had been canceled when we missed our first flight. The individual at the desk this time got on the phone to try to sort things out with us. They found that we would be expected to buy new tickets for a flight home. Again it was suggested that we pay over $300 per passenger to secure our flights home. The individual helping me at the desk held my hand and assured me they understood how I was feeling, but they couldn’t convince the person on the other side of the phone to help us. Eventually, the person on the other end of the phone conceded to crediting is with the cost of our original flights home so that we would pay the difference instead of the full charge to rebook. As if this was some sort of favor... we eventually concede to pay out of desperation to get home for work the next day. All in all, we essentially paid for our entire trip twice. Though the hit to my bank account was painful, the biggest sting wasn’t ultimately the cost; it was the loud and proud message that I only mattered to Delta as a customer if I had been willing to pay more money to them on the front end. Well Delta, you win. You have my money, but certainly not my respect, and surely not my business. Just earlier this year, I had traveled home with an economy airline to help move my grandmother into a nursing home. I had purchased a round trip, but my grandmother ended up passing away and I extended my stay through to my brothers wedding which I had already purchased flights for."

For my wife and myself, we will miss our connecting flight to Jamaica. Our $1,000 a night resort won’t change our reservations because it is already booked past our date.

Customer Service says one thing and the agents at the airport another. I was told to pay for a checked bag by an agent even though customer service told me it was included. They also shame and embarrass customers for buying economy class tickets. Never flying with them again and will advise anyone I know not to fly with them.

We paid to get from LAX to Spokane, not just halfway. 1.5 hour wait time to speak with a rep. So I guess we're walking from Seattle to Spokane because we didn't realize these crooks require customers to pay an extra $15 per seat to ensure that you actually get a seat on the flight you paid for."

I was traveling with my 2.5 year old son who said he was cold during the flight and when I asked flight attendant for a blanket I was told they didn’t provide any for that flight, however, as I was leaving the plane I couldn’t help but notice a bunch of unused still in the plastic wrap blankets laying on the floor between the first class seats.

We get to Miami only to be told our flight was canceled again. We got the same fueling excuse. It is horrible. No communication and liars.

We were told we needed to wait until it unloaded passengers. Then we were told there was another plane ahead of us in the line to the gate. We waited some more until we were told that the plane needed to go to another gate. This is about 40 minutes later the we got off the plane. We were told to take a shuttle bus to the baggage claim. That bus filled up before we could board and we needed to wait for a second bus. The second bus arrived and before we boarded the dispatcher told us to get off at the 2nd stop. The bus driver and a second dispatcher argued about whether to wait for another flight to fill the bus before we departed. The driver did not want to wait so we left and at the second stop they switched drivers. The new driver refused to let us get off the bus. He proceeded to drive us back to where we started. We told the dispatcher what happened and he berated us for listening to the driver rather than sympathize with our being subjected to wasted time and confusion. We called Delta and related the story. The service person on the phone said 'What do you expect me to do about this?'. I said this is very poor service and is there some way we could be compensated. She disconnected me. Do not fly Delta.

Firstly my flight from Lansing Michigan to Detroit was fine. However my flight from Detroit to Atlanta had an hour and a half layover which was okay with me. As soon as I stepped off the plane from Lansing, I received an email that my flight would be delayed another hour which was okay with me once again. I had a connecting flight in Atlanta to Gulfport that departed at 9.38. My flight from Detroit was supposed to land in Atlanta at 7.48 didn't land there until 9.15. After sprinting to the gate after having to stare at a monitor for my gate number I hurriedly made my way to my gate only for them to announce that my flight departed 5 minutes early. I was in tears almost with how frustrated I was. I was trying to get to Mississippi to see my brother off before he got deployed and also celebrate his birthday before he left. Fortunately the flight attendant was able to give me a care pouch and a hotel room although I had no access to my luggage and my cellphone was dying. Eventually I made it to Gulfport and spent time with my brother before he left for deployment. On my way back home, my flight from Atlanta to Detroit was delayed once again causing me to miss my connecting flight home. My mother who was 50 plus years old drove at midnight to come and get me from Detroit airport because they wouldn't give me a hotel room for the night and wanted everyone to stay the night in the airport. There was no remorse when I called customer service and explained everything to them. They told me they'd get back to me in seven business days for my refund for the last of my trip and offered me a $25 gift card. This was by far the worst experience and I will more than likely never fly Delta again. I was better off flying Spirit. Delta Charges too much money for them to be treating their customer's like this. Never again."

I not only fly Delta, I pay for the sky club every year and I have a Delta American Express card. Even though I have to consider all airfare costs, all the time for my company, I prefer Delta and choose Delta whenever possible, until now. I have spent decades building up my points. Late nights, early mornings, delayed flights, 60+ overnight stays a year away from my family and more. It’s a lot of sacrifice to be able to take advantage of miles I’ve worked extremely hard for once or twice a year, only find out, Delta can manipulate markets and gauge customers like me and pull all those decades of earned miles right out of my pocket in an instance. And not a few thousand, 100s of thousands! Which brings me to my issue. My fiancé is from Brazil. She comes from a big family with great tradition of family events and putting family first. Her parents are celebrating 50 years of marriage. We can not miss that event. I’ve been working on a trip to take advantage of my rewards from decades of travel. It occurred to me, that if I am to leave my native city (Atlanta) to Sau Paulo. The cost for us to leave Atlanta is outrageous. The points cost us more than double compared to other airports in the vicinity. We’re trying to work through it and be creative but it is a huge waste of time and energy. Not only in trying to source the trip and solve the problem, but also in having to fly to another airport just to preserve my hard earned points. And this email is just another big waste of my time. To make matters worse you’re having us leave an airport (Miami) we don’t even want to depart from, only to come back to Atlanta and do a 10 hour layover. To make matters worse my fiancé can not afford to travel that day to Miami and back to Atlanta, because she only has a sitter for the Atlanta to Sau Paulo trip and we’re struggling to find a way to keep her in Atlanta, even if I have to go out of my way to Miami, just to protect some of my hard earned points. If I was to transition her ticket to the Atlanta portion only, the cost to my personal point status is crippling. I’m writing to you because I’ve been loyal for decades. I’ve supported Delta for decades (flights. Credit cards, sky club, etc). I’ve never complained. I’ve supported you and now your fleecing my points because you’re too rigid to solve this problem. I can’t accept the negative impact I’m being subjected to, after all the sacrifice I’ve withstood to earn my points. I don’t accept it. You tag line, printed on your napkin (see photo) states, 'the world is better without you in it'. What you’re doing to me, my fiancé, her daughter and our trip flies in the face of this tag line. You’re supposed to encourage us to venture out, travel, adventure, etc.. Not discourage us and penalize us. I’m not some one-timer. Look at my vast history. The fact that you’re setting markets up for price gauging with a personal impact to someone like me, is completely opposed to your messaging. So if you’re going to be an impediment to your own tag line, I’d suggest you stop using it."

My Husband and I celebrated our 1-year Anniversary and thanks to Delta to give us a horrible ending to our vacation. It first started in Miami where there were 2 or 3 delays for the flight from Miami to Atlanta, there were no announcements regarding why the delays were happening and no information given whatsoever. The weather was a little overcast sky, but that was it. Once we finally boarded the aircraft, we landed in Atlanta 15 minutes after our connected flight had already left. We were not sure what our next steps were, so we went to the Delta Help counter on Concourse A where we encountered a nasty, condescending, rude, disrespectful employee. It was bad enough that we were upset that we missed our flight, but to make matters worse to endure her and her unpleasant attitude. First of all, in Miami there was no reason given why our flight was delayed and then when we got to Atlanta we had to stay in the airport all night and were not compensated or reimbursed for anything, not so much as a blanket, a cup of coffee or water. I understand that things happen but to be treated in the matter of which we were is Unacceptable and definitely not customer-oriented or customer friendly, at all. From the first delay, where there were no updates, to the rude employee, to no compensation for anything, not to mention that my husband and I missed a day of work and missed wages and had to pay an extra day of parking at our original destination where we had parked and pre-paid. I definitely would not recommend your airline to anyone. Based on the unjust treatment and the lack of concern from your company and employee Lucille, I somehow, sincerely doubt that this complaint would be viewed or given any consideration, but I had to air my true disappointment in a company that I view totally different now."

No one in my family will  fly Delta again. They do not care about you or your family in any way. I really feel for those less fortunate who did not have the resources I did."

After take off two snacks (snack mix & biscoff cookies) and a drink from a selection of alcoholic or soft drinks were provided free of charge! Vegetarian meals were handed out a few minutes before the standard meals, meal was horrible, a vegetarian (not vegan) consisted of gluten free pasta, no dairy whatsoever, along with a salad and a gluten free bread roll. I would suggest vegetarians opt for the vegetarian meal that is provided onboard without needing to preorder. Asked for the other vegetarian meal that people who did not preorder got and it was great. Cabin crew were extremely attentive and did a drinks service every 45 minutes. About 2.5 hours before landing a vegetarian snack bag and burrito was handed out which were both decent. About 1 hour before landing ice cream was handed out.  I had lost my phone and had asked the cabin crew if it was okay if I could have a look for it at my seat they allowed me too and even helped me search for it. Had a nice conversation with the same member of cabin crew, one thing about Delta is they have outstanding staff. We collected our baggage which was fine and not damaged whatsoever.

We planned our honeymoon following immediately after for Monday Aug 5th, 2019 to Saturday Aug 10th, 2019 to Oranjestad, Aruba. Though we’ve never flew with Delta airlines before, there were no worries that our honeymoon would be amazing. When we arrived to the Delta check – in , there was an older gentlemen who was kind enough to help get our luggage checked in, he stated that he had just sent us off to Aruba and that some sort of gratuity would be in order, we tipped him and went on our way. Things were running smooth, however, instead of departing at 7:00 am like our boarding passes stated, Delta flight 1080 to ATL start boarding at 7:00 am, which posed no issue at the time us, because my husband and I were present at the gate. Although boarding to ATL was passed time, the flight made good timing. We arrived in ATL at 9:50 am instead of 9:31am like our boarding passes and check in stated. My husband and I had assigned seats in the back of the plane, separately in rows 35 B and 35 F. It took a total of 20 minutes to get off the Delta flight 1080 from STL. We got off from our flight around 10:10 am, unlike other airlines we have been on, Delta requires you to go see a monitor for further instructions on boarding. My husband and I immediately went to the nearest monitor to locate the appropriate gate for our connecting flight to Aruba. In the Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, there is a train that connects at each gate.

Boarding had ended, and our fight had fully departed. My heart sank, we were in disbelief. Frantic, I ask the Delta representative at gate E 14 where our plane was and the gentlemen stated that the flight left at 10:26 am. My husband and I spoke with several representatives who were rude and unempathetic as they made things seems as though it was our fault that we were late. I was honestly unable to comprehend why our flight was gone and it was well before 10:41 am. Absolutely devastated, my questions meant nothing to anyone. There was even a gentleman who worked for Delta who felt it was appropriate to tell us that he called us on the intercom to board while we were on our way from our first flight because they knew we had checked in from our previous flight from STL. We were offered a complimentary flight for the next day only after we asked to speak to a supervisor. Defeated, we accepted with no choice. We asked for a complimentary room for Delta’s inconvenience and we were laughed at by the Supervisor. My husband and I spent the first day of our honeymoon in the Hartsfield-Jackson Airport. (over 24 hours)  My husband and I had no luggage as we spent the night in an unknown State. We were responsible for late check in fees to our resort in Aruba.  We were charged cancellation fees for reservations made on our first day of arrival. We will never forget our horrific experience and never trust this airline again, regardless of cost. "

I get weather causes delays and cancellations, but not for 2 days. When I contacted Delta, they offered $25 or 500 miles in the spirit of goodwill.

Delta does not allow you to sit standby if you buy their basic economy class. You have to pay for the more expensive tickets for this feature.

Generally I really like Delta flights and how they are ran. But this is a serious customer service issue. Other airlines still allow you to fly standby on earlier flights for free. Delta decided to be greedy and monetize this. It takes them very little effort and probably makes them more money in the long run to allow standby passengers for free. It make sure the flights are full and provides the airline better flexibility in later flights to change and add passengers. But, Delta decided to go to the dark side on this one, forgo good will to their customers and make that extra $75. I personally will make sure to fly United or Southwest in the future if I have the reasonable option. I'm not swearing off Delta entirely as I care for convenience in my travel first and foremost, but I do guarantee I will purchase at least a couple fewer Delta tickets this year. I suggest if you want the flexibility to fly standby without any extra charge, that you fly with a different airline as well."

The whole registration process was a mess. At first we were told by a registration agent that he wasn't registered for a program, when I insisted that he was as I wouldn't be able to purchase a ticket without registering him for a program, the agent was able to find a record. Without apologizing for the stress, he proceeded registering my brother and printed his boarding pass with the assigned seat that I requested 6 moths ago 40A (near the window). At the time of the boarding after standing in line we were told by the stewardess in a pretty rude tone that my brother will be boarding the last. We waited for an entire airplane to board and the stewardess finally nodded us that we can go ahead. She then printed additional slip and without showing it to me took my brother to board. When the plane took off, my brother texted me that he was seated to the seat #17 in between two other passengers and his requested and already assigned seat was given away to somebody else. Nobody told me that at the time I was passing my brother to the Delta Airline agent, and needless to say my brother who studies English as a second language wasn't able to raise a concern on his own. I felt helpless and very disappointed. The terrible service we received cost us $150 in addition to the plain ticket and caused the worst international travel experience. This complain was submitted at the airline website first to give them a chance to respond. After waiting for a month with no respond, I am re-posting here."

I hate that I’m wasting more energy on Delta, but people need to know how they treat people, their kids, and their belongings. My kids had an unaccompanied minor reservation. Anytime you make an unaccompanied minor’s reservation, you have to do it over the phone. So when I got to the airport an hour and a half before my kids flight, Delta proceeded to tell me that they could not go through TSA because they had to be two hours early. I begin to explain to them that no one informed me of this very strict rule, and that I had no way of knowing that. They were condescending towards me and said it wasn’t their job to tell me when to be at the airport, and I could read it in the “contract I signed”. I informed them that I clearly haven’t signed anything, because it’s an airline requirement that I book over the phone. I asked if they could get a flight for them that same day, but they could not due to flight times. So I then asked if they could compensate us in someway for the inconvenience because I had to work a double the next day and they said no and I got upset and began to panic because I didn’t know what to do (I have severe anxiety), and she immediately got fed up with me and told me that she would not help me and that she would just document that I got there late (which is a lie). She then told me that I needed to call the unaccompanied minors hotline to change my kids flight if I wanted any help at all. I then called the hotline, and that person helped, and was apologetic. So because of this, I had to wake up at 4:30 a.m to get them to the airport on time and then go straight to work to work a double. But when we got to the airport the next day, and we were checking my daughters suitcase at the desk, the delta employee put her bag on the belt without  tagging it first! I look at her like... is my kids bag going to get lost? She assured me it would arrive to their destination. I didn’t believe them but I wasn’t going to waste time asking for management after the way I’d been treated before. So we finally get to the gate, and when they go to board the delta employee snaps at the parents to say their goodbyes and was just very stern in general, and when I was hugging my kids goodbye she snapped at me and said “you need to stay back” I just looked at her like “I’m just trying to hug them goodbye” and even another mom came up to me and said “they have no sympathy for moms with anxiety, do they?” And if only she knew the half of it. You’d think this review stops here, but it doesn’t. Hours after I send my kids off with these unprofessional people, which I wish I hadn’t, I get a text from my son saying that there was a problem with the gate, and that they got there late and we’re at a completely different airport. Mind you, I am paying a couple hundred dollars for someone to escort them to their gate on time, And to make sure they get to the correct destination and airport. And THEN I find out that they in fact sent my kids suitcase to the wrong airport, and their dad had to drive to two different airports and pay $50 in parking. I will never fly Delta again, nor will I recommend them."

If you’re in a rush to get home and want to end up frustrated because you’re stuck in an airport, I highly recommend flying with Delta Airlines.

Long version: I made a mistake while booking two-way flight tickets from Boston to Nashville. Travelling from Boston to Nashville did go well on August 5th. I booked my return flight for the very next day (August 6th) at least I thought that. However, I realized that I did book my return ticket for August 7th while checking in at Airport. I didn't know how to react (I was the victim for my mistake). Anyways, went to counter and the Delta person was really polite and nice. He asked for a moment to talk with someone behind the counter and he returned saying I am good to travel today (August 6th) for no more charges or anything. I was expecting for pay somewhere around $50 - $100 USD. But they were too good to forgive my mistake and now I am at the gates about to board the flight to Boston. Thank you Delta (and your employees)!"

We were not seated together & I couldn't change it online because there was not seen entire row available for us so I waited until I got to the gate & requested a change which worked out well for me until I reached Atlanta on our way back. I asked the representative at the gate if she could change the seats & she stated ""Ma'am this flight is completely booked so you'll have to figure it out when you get on the plane."" I stood there for a moment & I asked her if there were any other options & she said yes you have the option to figure it out yourself. I grabbed my 2 kids & begin to broad the plane in tears which is when the flight attendants were beyond helpful in placing me and my small children together.

Understandably, we were delayed from a 9:25pm flight due to bad weather (thunderstorms, rain, etc), and they had to search for a new route to take. This took 3.5 hours, which I guess is justifiable when looking for a safe route. HOWEVER, for some reason we had to make a stop in Minnesota for a pilot change. The flight crew assured us that a new one would be waiting at the airport so it’d be a quick stop so we can get back on our way. Sure why not, maybe the pilot was supposed to be off around our original departure time. BUT, it takes 2.5 hours to get from New York to Minnesota and on top of the 3.5 hour original delay, they had 6 hours to find a new pilot. Guess what? When we arrived at the airport there was no pilot available. They told us it’d be another 3 hour delay annoying literally everyone on board because they couldn’t find another pilot to take over. It was 3am when we arrived, so we leave again at 6am. Well guess what, 2 hours into the wait they said it’s likely going to be an extra 1.75 hours (departure now 7:45am) because they STILL couldn’t find another damn pilot to fly the stupid plane. This comes to a total of around 8 hours of flight delays with half of the time not being due to weather anymore, but incompetence. It’s 5am as I write this (they just made the extended delay announcement), and I’m hoping it doesn’t extend again cause this is ridiculous. Will never fly with again."

When I asked the rebooking agent how they can change your gate and not tell you? she said they were not allowed to announce gate changes. This made no sense to me I assumed Delta was cashing in on the unrefundable nature of our ticket. If not They probably assumed sitting at gate A6 we could hear the announcements for our flight boarding at gate A9 when there were 3 restraints and a sound wall between these gates what they should have done is completely refund our ticket and given us free seats on the next flight out.

I attempted to file a claim but was notified that Delta does not cover broken wheels or handles. What else would even break on a suitcase? It is very disappointing that the staff is allowed to throw paying customers' suitcases around, break them, and no one is held accountable.

As a frequent flyer, I typically choose Southwest when traveling for vacation or business. I have experienced delays, diversions, and cancellations numerous times and greatly appreciated the courtesy of the southwest airlines employees. However, my family and I chose Delta for our flight to Germany as the prices were much cheaper than Southwest. Upon arrival to Midway on a Monday morning, we stood in line for 30-45 minutes just to check our bags because they only had 1 person working. this person completely ignored the long line of non-sky miles passengers, including a disabled man who was struggling to stand for the long wait period. Fast forwarding to our flight, we were delayed 3 separate times (at the fault of weather, not Delta). However, we had to reschedule our flight to depart from O'Hare due to an insufficient layover time. We proceeded to Midway Delta baggage claim office and found that the door was locked and the office left empty. We asked the Delta office next door for assistance and they rudely told us to return exactly where we came from. Even though we are in a hurry to catch our flight at O'Hare airport, we were met Delta workers who were extremely rude, dismissive, and unwilling to help us. I can confidently say that this will be my first and only experience with Delta airlines. we will not be returning."

To top it off, we went to the Delta Sky Club to sit in quiet comfort for our 2 1/2 hr layover in St. Paul Minneapolis and we’re told “you can’t come in here”.

I paid extra weight and I went in the plane, when I was in the plane, in my seat 24F a Delta employee told me they had taken out a couple of bottles of liquor, after I paid for the extra weight. She told me that in order to get my bottles back all I had to do was call Delta the moment we landed. When I got home I noticed they had taken bottles of 4 of my suitcases not just one. That they had taken out 28 bottles. The problem was that when I called them the same night they said they had nothing but they would call me back, two weeks later passed they still hadn't call me and every single time I called I was told ""we will call you back"". I called them back almost every single day, every single time it was a different story and when finally someone told me that in fact those bottles where there, the next day they would say they had nothing. I don't understand how those bottles be there one day and then be gone the next day. As much as I like Delta I have to say that they or whoever opened my suitcases broke the rules because by law they are supposed to open my suitcases in front of me, they are supposed to call me to let me know that they are going to open them and none of that happened. Its over a month now and I've only gotten 7 of my bottles after they said they had 8. I no longer know what to do. I call Delta I call the TSA and all they say is that they only have 7 when I know for a fact that they have the remaining bottles."

I spoke to 3 customer service reps, 2 by phone and 1 at the airport, and none were helpful in getting me on a new flight. What frustrated me most is they didn’t even try and offered me a $25 meal voucher. Keep in mind the terminal has about 2 food options, both of which are terrible, so I declined the voucher. I could have driven home sooner than the new arrival time, but because they notified us about the delay an hour before take off, it was too late to leave the airport, shuttle to the car rental, and drive home (leaving this airport is a nightmare).

We were on a flight from Asheville to Bonaire via Atlanta. The flight from Asheville had a small mechanical problem. It took the mechanic less than a minute to fix, however it took the mechanic 1.5 hours to get to the airport. Really? So we, four of us, missed our flight to Bonaire. This was at 9am and we are in Atlanta now for a full 24 hours - they would not put us on another flight. We go to the customer service desk and give us voucher to a motel that their employees do not even stay in. We asked for another option, with a restaurant and they said they do not give hotel vouchers to hotels with restaurants. No food vouchers, no transportation, nothing. We asked to talk to a manager and they gave us a number that is only answered Monday through Friday 9 to 5pm. It is a Saturday and we are flying out of the country. We have a water front condo with two bedrooms and a car rental that we lost out on. The next day we have to check our bags in all over again. My husband and I wait in line to check our bags in. We had picked them up the day before so we could have our things. After 25 minutes to do this, we are told we have to go into another line b/c there is no record we had paid for a bag the day before to Bonaire. There was another 20 to 30 minute line. I asked if she could take us to the front of the line and she said no. My husband nearly had a melt down. He gave me the dressing down and she felt so badly she took us over and checked us in.

1320,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Paris,July 2019,2,4,3,,1,,2,0,Not Verified ,"  New York to Paris. I purchased three tickets for my mother and my daughters to travel to Paris together for the month of July since I was already in the city for my Master's program. My children checked-in with my brother who was going to Paris for the week since they arrived at the same time. When my mother arrived at check-in, she wasn't able to because the Delta agents in New York had put her name on my brother's luggage. My brother and daughters checked in around 6:30 PM and my mother didn't get to the airport until almost 8:00 PM to check-in for the same flight. The only thing they have in common is the same last name. The solution proposed by Delta was that she pay $100 to check-in her 1 bag as a second piece of luggage or have my brother come back out from the terminal so they could ""try to fix it"". Once you go through security, you can't come back out to the check-in counter. How do you ask someone to pay extra for your own incompetence and negligence? When you issue a baggage label you are looking at the passport, the boarding pass and the person in front of you. That's an extra level of incompetence on the part of Delta which makes me question their level of security. After their mistake, they gave my mother the run-around for over 30-minutes, then they told her that she wasn't able to check-in anymore because check-in stops one hour before boarding. There were a ton of agents just hanging around at the counters and no other customers. While they are saying this, my children and brother are texting me that the flight has been delayed and they are waiting at the terminal for an update. Then, Delta proposed that the only thing she could do was either re-book with them for a different flight on a different day and she would have to pay for the re-booking. Then they stated that they couldn't do anything because the ticket was purchased with a travel agency. After speaking to different Delta representatives and supervisors, through some ""miracle"", one of them rebooked her for a direct flight with Air France. She arrived in Paris 8 hours before my children and brother which was a major inconvenience. When all was done, my mother's luggage was missing from her flight with Air France as well as my brothers' from his flight. My children' pieces of luggage arrived one after the other on the conveyer belt. It's suspect that the two pieces of luggage missing happen to be the ones with my mother's name on them. So far, my brother's luggage was delivered the day after they arrived, but my mothers' has not yet been delivered. As of today July 6th (4 days after arrival), we were informed by Air France that they never received a marked bag for her from Delta and that her luggage is likely still in New York. They think that the baggage tag was ""probably removed"" from the suitcase which is why it never made it on the next direct flight. She's suffering from severe chronic asthma and diabetes because her extra medication was in her luggage. Now we're in Paris, she struggled to get around the past few days and had to be taken to the emergency room by ambulance today. As someone who travels every year, I will do my best to ensure that those whom I know don't travel with Delta and that I don't take a flight associated with Delta again."

On our ride to Orlando from LaGuardia we had a nine hour layover due to the incompetence of the Delta staff. After our original flight was delayed and we missed our connection we were put on the waiting list first. They told us there was no room for us and proceeded to board the people after us on the list. When we got to Orlando Delta lost one of our fellow passengers luggage and said “whoops we’ll see if we can send it to your house later”, the lady whose luggage was lost was in tears and the Deltas employees flippant attitude made it worse. Delta had to cancel a flight to Georgia due to the weather in LaGuardia even though other flights were still taking off. Because they blaimed weather that affected no other flights the people whose flights were cancelled were not compensated. The gate changes are almost impossible to keep up with too. As I write this horrible review I am waiting for a flight that has yet again been delayed last minute. I lost a day at Disney due to Deltas incompetence. Here is my parting advice Delta does not care about you they just want your money they will lie to you and cheat you and swindle you because in the end they know you’ll come back if the flights are cheap enough. Its an air plane menopoly and they will never ever be honest with you. The only minor source of joy is a small TV with no volume."

It used to be that they would announce close connections, allow those people to get off first. Not here. We were at the back of the plane and didn't de-board until 10:44. We had twenty-four min to make our connection in another part of airport. I asked gate attendant to call ahead and let them know we were coming. He shook his head no and we started at a dead run. Me and family (four of us) We made it there at 10:58. The gate was closed. They closed a full 15 min early, knowing they had a close-connecting flight. A couple there who were in the front of our plane arrived two min earlier than we did. The gate was not closed because it's ""regulation"" to close 15 min prior to take off. It closed 15 mins prior to take-off to board their standby employees. That's what I was later told. I would like proof of this but don't have it. Delta has it. The next morning June 13 we took a flight (DL3467) to Tulsa departing at 8:25. It closed its gate at 8:21. Four minutes prior to take-off. So it is not a regulation. Six people I know of missed the flight the night before because Delta breached our contract and inflicted emotional distress in order to further their own causes by boarding their own people. When we went to customer service that night, they refused to pay for the hotel because the plane was ""not that late."" They blamed us for missing the flight. I told them that was unacceptable and they finally made a call and okayed ours and everyone's overnight stay (found this out later on bus to hotel). A side note: on June 7 fight DL1846 leaving Tulsa at 6:42 to Atlanta then Boston we also missed the connecting flight in Atlanta due to mechanical issues which I understand. But we spent the night sleeping on airport chairs. No apologies, no offer of pillows, no offer of blankets, etc. Delta is unfriendly and does not care about its customers. Once they take your money, they don't care. I answered their survey re these flights and asked for a manager at Delta to call me. I've heard nothing. "

What could have been a terrible situation was handled very well and we will continue to recommend and fly with Delta."
1328,1,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Providence to Miami,April 2019,2,4,4,1,3,,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Providence to Miami. My bag was mis-tagged and sent to Augusta. We kept being told by Delta that this was impossible and they do not know how it happened. We were flying down to Miami for a cruise that left the next day. We went to the Delta lost luggage counter when we arrived in Miami and were told my bag was re tagged and would arrive to us by 11pm that night at our hotel. I woke up at 9am the next day and no bag had been delivered. We were boarding our cruise boat at 2pm and i had no belongings. The bag arrived 30 minutes later but it was not my bag. It is assumed that this was the bag of the man which my bag was mistagged under. It was easter so we could not even go to a clothing store to get any clothes since everything was closed . Our two vacation days in Miami prior to the cruise were ruined. We had to waste time at the bag counter and stop at stores to get belongings instead of enjoying our trip. We spent the two days on and off the phone with Delta. Luckily the bag arrived right before the cruise boat left. They did reimburse us for belongings we had to buy prior to getting on the boat which is appreciated, but does not fix the fact that they ruined part of my trip. I feel that mistagging my bag with a different persons name is a huge mistake. If that guy or someone else took my bag I would have never seen it again. I emailed Delta to speak with them about the matter twice and they have not even acknowledged my email."
1329,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Chicago via Detroit,June 2019,1,1,,,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  My experience with Delta Airlines was absolutely horrific and will be something I remember from my most recent trip for the rest of my life. My flight schedule was as follows, DFW->DTW->ORD (with Delta) -> BCN (Norwegian) My flight out of DFW was scheduled to depart to DTW at 7:15 AM. Due to ""technical difficulties,"" we sat boarded for two hours in the terminal. Finally, the airline crew then decided to restart the plane -literally turned it off, and turned it back on- and the issue resolved itself. This was not reassuring, as the pilot seemed to have a legitimate safety concern with the plane. It was also frustrating that it took them two hours to come to this solution. It goes without saying, I missed my connection from DTW to ORD due to this delay. The next flight out of DTW to ORD was at 3:55 which made it extremely close to missing the check-in deadline for my international flight with Norwegian at 6:30. Nevertheless, I was determined to make it work, so I got in the Delta Customer Service queue to make the arrangements. To preface this, the woman behind me in line had the exact same flight itinerary as me, so we were in the same dispositions. When I reached the counter they told me that there were no available seats at this time and that I would have to fly standby for the 3:55 flight and gave me a ticket for the 5:07 flight out of DTW - which would most definitely make me miss my international flight. I pleaded, nearly in tears, for her to do anything to help me as my flight with Norwegian was non-refundable. Unempathetically, she explained there was nothing she could do. After the line, I went to the restroom to catch my breath and met back up with the lady behind me to see what she was going to do. To my disgust and surprise, the same staff gave her a flight on the 3:55 PM seconds after she told me there was nothing she could do.  After I heard this, I got back in line and she conveniently found me a spot on the 3:55 PM flight. Once again, the flight was delayed for various reasons- one time they said technical and the other was the weather. I approached a different help desk, as now I 100% was going to miss my flight, and I was serviced by a different Delta employee (I did not catch her name but I wish I did). She proceeded to yell at me to the point I had to ask her to, ""Please, stop yelling at me."" She responded in a yelling voice, ""I am not yelling at you, just give me your ticket!"" This reduced me to tears of frustration and humiliation. When I boarded the plane, which was a full flight, I was looking for a space to put my carry-on in an overhead bin. The flight attendant, quite rudely said, ""Can you not see that these are closed? It means they are full."" Rather than offering help to a visibly upset individual she made me feel stupid and unwelcome. Because Delta is not affiliated with Norwegian , they could not help me rebook my international flight and I lost my money on the ticket, a day of my vacation, and multiple tours and bookings due to multiple issues on Delta's part. I am disgusted by the lack of customer service."

I paid for Comfort+ seat which includes extra legroom and dedicated overhead bin space. My connecting flight (DL140 to Brussels) said that I have to check my carry-on baggage because the flight is too full. I am very upset that Delta would put other personal luggage in my overhead bin that I paid for. Then force me to check my baggage. It was such an inconvenience to take out my work and personal laptop.The staff members were very unprofessional and discriminated against me because of my skin color. I never like flying from New York, but I had no choice. I will never fly out New York again. Flying from Atlanta is more convenient and the Delta Staff members are friendly. Something has to done about this. It’s not fair to those who paid extra in order to avoid circumstances like this."

The last of the great the three great American airlines I fly with. Boarding was a mess: there were so many different classes, it gets confusing. Also, people are called out for a boarding class that does not match what is written on the boarding pass (e. g. ""basic"" can be ""main""). And with two flights boarding at very close times, in such a tiny space, it got very confused to know who was being called for boarding, as the staff kept on talking one after the other (in Montreal) or kept on passing information one over the other (in Minneapolis). Some seats are assigned at the boarding stage. Had never seen this one and it seems an extra unnecessary step. Service on board could see some more smiling and some less mobile fun by some of the staff, in some cases."

We arrived at the airport at 3.00 in the morning because we were not notified our flight was delayed. The lady at the desk rescheduled our flight. Needless to say she messed up our connection flights. Luckily we caught her mistake and we attempted to fix it. It took a half hour of bantering with another Delta employee before we finally correctly rescheduled our flight. We spent 7 hours waiting for that flight. We were not compensated and I was left feeling like Delta did not care about me or any of my fellow passengers. I missed a day at Disney our vacation destination. The service was stiffer than the chairs.

Traveling with a young child (age 1) is never pleasant. On the first leg of the flight, Delta did not have any bassinets so the baby sat on my knee for 7 hours. On the second leg, we were told we would have one bassinet. We did not. They told us we would have a spare seat at least. We did not. An upset family took the spare seat after they too had been screwed around by Delta. Staff admitted that we had been lied to on several occasions. All staff, bar one, were rude and just couldn't care. Delta just don't care. After 23 hours with a baby on my lap, no sleep and terrible food - I promised I would do something to balance the world back out by leaving this review and telling people to pay the extra $30 to go with a proper airline. We both received a $50 apology voucher but have no intention of ever flying Delta again."

I showed up at the airport at 1 PM for a flight leaving at 5:06pm. I was told by the lady at the gate that the earliest I could check in will be 4 hours prior to departure. Then I replied oh that works then since it's 1pm so I'm in the 4 hours window. She then says, no you can't check in because our gate is not opened yet and I'm like ""didn't you just said I could check in 4 hours prior"" she then says no I should come back at 3pm that's the earliest time they would open. She just contradicted herself right there. I left , checked in online,paid my bag then showed up 4:25pm which was 40min prior to departure and was told they can't take my paid bag even though I checked it online after they refused to check me in 4hours before. I was then provided a number to call and the person I spoke with, told me they can't do anything and I would have to talk to the agents at the airport which is odd because the agent told me to call you. Now time to board , I'm told they have to check in my carry on (my bag was already gone because they wouldn't take it) and I told them I don't feel comfortable checking in my carry on because I had things stolen before and I have my laptop and they replied ""you don't want to check it, you won't board""."

They made no announcements, and the lady that was making announcements at that gate spoke only broken English. Got a new flight booked for 12:50. So after sitting in the airport terminal for almost five hours, the dirtiest, most haggard airplane I've ever seen shows up at the terminal. We board and the captain comes over the intercom. He warns us that the APU is not working properly, and they cannot put cold air into the cabin, or start the main engines. We wait for a start cart. After cooking in the plane for half an hour while they wait, they tell us to go back to the terminal. If I had known I was going to go through this, I would have drove. I would have been there already. Now I'm sitting in the terminal still."

So here is my daughter a mess at the airport no flight. I contacted several people at Delta whom were all pleasant to speak with and trying to be very helpful the whole process. After being on hold and different people it was now 11 pm and couldn't do anything more. Next morning 6:30 Am called and spoke with a Jack in Dallas, who took the situation and quickly helped me place my daughter on the next direct flight to London. No up charge and excellent service.

My husband is on Kidney dialysis and we must travel with a portable dialysis machine which cannot be checked in it must be checked and hate to stay with him at all times. We label the machine in lime green duct tape with large letters stating it’s a medical device. This machine was pink tagged by Delta as well meaning it cannot go on a luggage carousel. We traveled from Atlanta to Puerto Rico on June 7th. When we landed our machine was not waiting on us to deboard the flight. We were told that the device had been thrown into the carousel. This is a $4000 machine and a life or death device for my husband and they overlooked the markings and tags and just threw on the carousel. They did realize their mistake and radioed the luggage department. However they did not advise us of any of this. We spent 20 minutes looking for the machine on the carousel. I finally decided to look for someone and found the luggage office. Our device was in the office!! This special $500 car that transports it was damaged luckily the machine was not. When a complaint was made the pulled the pink tagged marked by Delta it was under the wrong name!! Had this luggage been lost we would have never been able to get it back. What really saddens us is no one seemed to care! You’re supposed to be the friendly sky! Shame on you Delta! Educate your employees!

Also I finally got to have the Delta signature Cocktail as the flight attendant knew how to make it. She even went out of her way to make it from scratch and not pouring it out of the pre made bottle that is loaded from the catering kitchen.

The usual service which was good in Business class meals and service prompt. However the drink service was awful because the flight attendant working my side of the plane did not know how to make drinks and she even mentioned she did not drink so did not know how much of what gets mixed. I was shocked as frequent flyer who travels Business Class for international travel with a variety of airlines. At this point I am wondering how Delta allowed this person to pass the needed classes and training given. She did not know how to make Delta's signature cocktail which is highlighted in the menu card given. So much for the cocktail that Delta raves about. I ended up having to take a coke zero twice. Fastforward to morning time about six hours later before landing at AMS. The same person is working my side this time she walks by for breakfast I ask for Coffee and she has to move the cart as to others wanting to use the bathroom and then totally forgets to serve us breakfast. I even brought it to her attention but she did not care. ThankfulIy I was not hungry. If anyone from Delta actually reads this make sure your cabin crew is fully trained for International flights more so for Business class service.

The self service machine upstairs was broken. Staff showed zero empathy and made no effort to help.

Because of bad reviews I was a bid worried about my flight with Delta. But in the end it was a nice and enjoyable flight. The check in and the transfer in Atlanta worked out fine. I was a bit surprise how long the boarding takes, because of all the small groups being called to get to the gate. That explains why I have to be at the gate so early. But how cares as long as it works. The flight attendants were very nice and helpful. It was a lot of fun to chat with them. They were great and very professional. Although we should not forget that they are on the flight for safety reasons and not only as waitresses and waiters. But I have my doubts that the age group of flight attendants during my flight is still able to do that. One flight attendant stumbled twice over a slight step on the floor. After so many years that should not happen any more. To make sure, it is not about youth and beauty, this is about safety. The service was excellent the food was fine and nothing to complain. The WiFi during the flight just for messages was amazing. I spend a lot of time by sending messages around the world. The seat was really old and not very comfortable. The length is okay but the width did not work at all. I was sorry that the new seats were not available. A big plus for me was the matter that my luggage could get through to Mexico. It is always a horror to pick up the luggage and drop it of again 5 seconds later. Finally it was a nice and smooth flight and if I have to fly with Delta again I will look forward to it."

Then, 1o minutes before boarding, flight is delayed another 4 hours! And then there was not contextual information given about what was the issue or when it would be resolved, only that they were “working on a replacement crew”. We missed an important family event (graduation) but also wasted a day in the airport waiting (we could have been working or spending time with our kids!). Then, when I call customer service, they offer us a $25 voucher! That’s just a complete insult. I would rather spend the next 5 hours in the airport writing negative reviews than accept $25.

Not A great way to end your vacation to come to an airport with the poorest customer service. We got to the airport around 2 our flight was to be boarded at 5:45. The flight has been delayed 7 times and when the plane finally landed it was given to Pittsburgh and we were told to go on the opposite side of the airport. Now our boarding “promised time” is 12:30 AM. We’ve tried talking to the attendants and they were all rude granted none of them could give us a straight answer. We spent $60 on food at the airport today. No vouchers were given and everyone on the Indianapolis plane were left clueless waiting. We could have booked different flights or stayed and enjoyed our time in the city.

When I returned for additional assistance, I was treated with hostility and when I expressed that I had health problems and could not go on any more wild goose chases in the airport and needed their assistance they threatened to call a paramedic. This was not out of concern but expressed rudely basically saying if you don’t shut up we will call a paramedic to come get you. I was clearly frustrated but I was not yelling or cussing as other customers were. I just needed help with locating my bag. I was so shocked and appalled by how I was treated by Delta."

I boarded the flight from Amsterdam to Atlanta and Atlanta to DFW, when I arrived DFW, they couldn’t locate my bag and they put I call to Atlanta and it was confirmed that the bag was at Atlanta and that the next flight to DFW will bring it. I waited for 5 hours the bag did not show up, they asked me to go that they will deliver the bag to my house in Wichita Falls. I kept on calling for the bag and it was from one story to another. They gave me a tracking number to track the luggage but after 3 weeks that the luggage did not show up, I called them and they told me that the luggage was missing. I filled claims which they refused to pay and referred me to UPS and UPS told that I should call Delta. After series of calls , Delta blocked my line and I couldn’t reach them anymore and after 5 months I still have not received my luggage. Just avoid them if you can because they don’t value their customers neither are organized."

The flight from Sydney was delayed causing me to miss my connection to Washington DC. They were only able to get me on a flight 4 hours later getting me into DC at midnight versus 4:30 with a stopover in Atlanta. Customer service is not helpful and infuriating.

However I have only flown with Delta a handful of times, and 2 out of the 3 or 4 times they lost my luggage by trying to check my carry on at the gate. I flew from Texas for my grandmother 75th surprise birthday party, but my luggage is in ATL. This is completely irresponsible and now I have nothing. Once I got to Atlanta they said my luggage was in baggage claim but it was suppose to follow me to Baltimore. Now I see why others were reluctant to check their carry ons at the gate. Customer service promised this would be resolved and my luggage would meet me in Baltimore after she ""rechecked it"". I'm not sure what that means but she was trying to help. I've called customer service this morning for an update on my luggage but I was on hold, and then got hung up on so now I'm on hold for another 18 mins and my grandmother's event starts in 4 hours. Not to mention that when I asked for a supervisor the woman said she was a manager and hung up on me. I have to rebuy everything! I dont even have a toothbrush or underwear for I dont know how long. I go back to Texas tomorrow and my baggage is in ATL. I regret buying this flight because I'm now a sitting duck with nothing. I dont think you all are a bad airline at all, but this is unacceptable and very expensive on my part. "

It is not only the worst airline, but consistently the worst airline and customer service that I have ever experienced. I missed my connection flight due to “weather” which they used as an excuse to not pay for a hotel room. Customer service was beyond rude and unhelpful and my overall travel with Delta cost me an extra $400 dollars beyond the ticket price. I would highly recommend that no one flies Delta and it is a shock that they are still in business with their lack of customer service and overall human decency. "
1363,4,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Lisbon,May 2019,2,2,2,4,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I flew for the first time on Delta Airlines and will surely be the last. On 21 May 2019 I traveled from Lisbon to Indianapolis via JFK and returned to Lisbon via Boston on May 28, 2019. On four flights there were 3 delays all for technical and mechanical reasons, which leaves me worried about the quality and maintenance of yours aircrafts One of the delays was more than three hours almost compromising the connecting flight to Lisbon and at this moment I am in Boston waiting to board again for mechanical reasons without being served a simple bottle of water. The flight at this time is already delayed 30 minutes and is expected to depart more than one hour late. Inadmissible, mainly because it is happening for the third time in three consecutive flights and in the same airline. Added to this is the fact that I have always been allocated seats in the tail of the planes on all flights when I requested an upgrade when booking and upon check-in. As a result of the assigned places I was left with no menu option once the option of meat was finished at lunch on the first intercontinental flight and on another flight, that of the three-hour delay, due to the host's incompetence, we were not served the drink at that we were entitled and for which we paid for ""lack of time""  Let's see what reserves this flight ... I must also express my displeasure at the approach of your collaborators at Lisbon Airport prior to check-in. I have often traveled to the USA on other airlines and such approach has never been done. Even a sticker put in the passport what is illegal when done by people without the authority to do so. I thought it was abusive. I also hate your way of managing boarding on the planes that I consider very complicated. The competitive rates do not compensate for the poor service provided, the lack of care and consideration for the passengers you sit in the last places of the plane. "

Great customer service, I still cannot believe what they have done for my friend and I. Long weekend in NYC, we got confused and went to the wrong airport resulting and missing our flight. We got at the JFK airport 40 minutes before the departure time. Even though we didn’t have any bags to check in, and the staff tried their best, it was impossible... we were too late. They were concerned and helpful getting us into the next fly available right the way. The supervisor Charlie went above and beyond any kind of customer service experience I ever had in any airline. He even suggests us to stay in Hotel near by the airport giving us directions and helping us to book a room. "

Quick flight regional aircraft quick friendly attendant. The Seattle Delta club was excellent.Great staff, great food and drink.Boarding the 757 to Kona, I thought I was imagining things. The first class section was actually pathetic. The amount of personal space and legroom was absolutely minimum.The attendants were incredible and offered great but unnecessarily rushed service for a 6 hour flight. They are the reason, the only reason to pay for a first class ticket and sit in a cattle car. The row ahead of me erupted into a screaming match because one of the party lost it when the guy in front reclined and she could no longer see her screen. Granted, she over reacted but this is how minimal the leg room was.Like coach ten years ago! Food was ok, drinks fine, entertainment good and wi fi worked well.

The Delta employee looked up my reservation and told me that it was ok, since my connecting flight had been delayed by an hour and that my next connecting flight from New York to Rome was delayed by an hour and a half. So everything would be fine. I arrived in Minneapolis and find out my connecting flight left right on time. I called Delta again two more times to find out what happened.

My boyfriend had a tight connecting flight, made it to the Delta gate in ATL 15 minutes before his next flight (the exact time specified to arrive before gates closed) and they wouldn't let him on my next flight! They even dropped his seat on his next flight as he was standing in front of them. His next flight was delayed 15 minutes so then he had to sit and watch his next flight standstill while he was treated with disrespect by the most unhelpful and rude people at the Delta terminal. And the best part? They offered him a discounted hotel (not even a free hotel stay!), no food, and no vouchers! I also called ATL to get in touch with a Delta representative and not only did they have me wait 2x longer on hold on the phone just to reach a representative, but finally once I was able to speak with a representative they said ""hmm that's strange, looks like his first flight landed 30 minutes before his next flight was scheduled to depart and his second flight was delayed 15 minutes so he had time."" Truly unacceptable! The least the Delta folks could do is be nice under the circumstances given it was not his fault..."

Then Delta refused to get us to our destination and delayed our entire trip by 30 hours because we were 30 minutes late due to a mechanical error. When we as individuals can see online there are seats available, however the airline tells us nothing is available for 3 days. Horrible service. Always getting pushed to someone else's problem."

However, they damaged two of my bags. We didn't plan on checking the carry-ons but did so because the flight was full. But instead of getting the bags at the ramp on the next stop, the carry-ons went all the way to our destination. We were not informed that these were going all the way to our destination when we checked them at the gate, and they weren't locked. When we picked them up, one of the bags had the front pocket zippers completely ripped off so there is now no way to close the front pocket, and the other carry on had tire tread marks all over it. On the way back, the large suitcase I checked was split open on one corner. It looked like they just threw the bag which landed on the corner and caused it to split. The large bag was only a year old and used only one time. The carry-ons were brand new. They were not overstuffed so the only way they could have been damaged is by mishandling by the baggage crew. I didn't know the procedure for filing a claim for the bags the night we discovered the damage and I didn't show the bags to Delta when I was at the airport, so I am now not able to file a claim to get a reimbursement. Delta really has no respect for your personal property."

On time departures and arrivals on this trip. Courteous in-flight crew. Clean aircraft. Pilots made timely announcements. Seats were a tad tight but entirely passable as was leg space - I had aisle seats. On the DTW-LGA route, the Airbus 320 had individual entertainment screens which in addition to a good selection of movies, TV shows, and music, also had a large variety of games (including chess). Head phones have to be bought for two dollars with a credit card. The screen also showed the flight path. In-flight service included, in addition to a variety of complimentary non-alcoholic beverages, a choice of snacks - cookies or Cheezit. Disembarking at the gates was quick. While changing at Detroit, I was very worried that I would miss the connection as I arrived at gate 2 in Terminal B and had to go to gate 75 in Terminal A. This would be among the longest of distances between two gates and I had only 37 minutes! My concerns were misplaced. I made it in good time. The flight between South Bend and Detroit does not offer any beverage service. Boarding on both flights went smoothly but with so many categories of passengers, airlines have finessed the system to a new high - and they implement it well! The disembarkation is less discriminatory - they start with the lowest numbered rows and go up. My recent travels with Delta have all been positive and the in-flight ambiance is pleasant and comfortable. Keep up the good work, Delta!"

I have purchased first class ticket on DL and paid fortune for it. In addition to that, DL charges $125 for pet in a cabin, which I happily paid. I took our small bird with us. Check-in staff was nice but flight attendant was worst possible, night mear that you cannot even imagine about. I was in a seat 3A, first thing she mention to other passenger next to me was “I have seen it all, but in 40 years I never experienced bird in a cabin” She was so nasty and so awful. She than asked what we wish to drink. I kindly ordered orange juice. Lady next to me got her water and my juice never arrived. Instead i got nasty looks every time she passed by. She was giving me terrible looks and passed by. Perhaps she hated guys with pets and hates everyone who is not up to her likings. She made sure I comply with a rule and place the bird under the seat, which is fine. She could at least be kind. I have never seen so much nastiness towards first class passengers We are returning to NY next week and will never fly Delta again.

When she finished informing me that I would not be able to fly without my pet due to extreme heat temperatures, I asked her when the next flight would be and she got extremely confrontational and asked me why I was interrupting her. I was so shocked I said, ""please finish,"" and she got an even worse attitude with me. I fully understand the flight regulations on pets with temperatures above 80F and simply asked when the next flight would be. I am active military and honestly would never select to fly with Delta again if it weren't for them accommodating military with pets.

1382,1,Boeing 737,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Boston Logan,May 2019,1,3,2,2,3,1,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Our travels via Delta were very unsatisfactory - said we were too late to check luggage (unpublicized baggage check cut off), missed first leg. Then wouldn't give us the credit card free bag deal, but the kicker was that when I flew (separately) from Atlanta to Boston on a cheap seat, I knew I would be at the end of the line. OK. Got a seat assignment - surely middle - but as I was to board the gate person said 'wait, your seat has been changed' and gave me a piece of paper with the new seat. No big deal I thought. Went to rear of plane and had trouble finding my seat-window seat - a 300 lb woman was in the middle seat! I managed to get into my mouse trap seat, she was friendly, I was OK, but later I realized that my middle seat a few rows ahead had been taken-likely a window person decided not to be shoe horned into 'my seat' and sit next to this woman (she was a nice person and clearly knew she was a 'customer of size' but I didn't see any point of being unpleasant). But that Delta would regard me of having no merit-that they'd seize my seat for another 'higher ranking customer' is beyond belief. It was only a 2 hour flight to Boston but I would likely have had to wet my pants if I needed to get to the restroom-so impossible was it to get out of my mouse trap. I will never fly Delta again. First choice: Southwest, second Air Alaska, third Jet Blue. Legacy airlines like Delta and United are terrible today. Avoid them."

The seats are to small (while leg room is sufficient) the actual seat does not comfortably fit someone with adult hips. The wifi does not work on the plane, even after we are at 10,000 feet. The staff is rude,  I understand that this job is stressful, but customer service requires a smile, a hello, and how may I help you. Not eye rolls and dismissive comments. Lastly, on every Delta flight I have ever been on they ask us to check bags, even though my bag is small enough to fit on the overhead. I understand it's to speed up the process, but Delta, you need to find another way because that is very inconvenient. I do not want to wait at baggage claim if I made the effort to pack light. We pay way to much for these tickets for this poor level of service."

1387,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Milan via New York,February 2019,2,3,3,3,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  
I booked a trip on Delta traveling from Atlanta to Milan via New York for a 9 day back country ski trip in the alps. The flight from ATL to NY was delayed over 2 hours leaving only 1 hour after landing in NY until the flight to Milan was taking off. I had 2 bags; one for skis and one for clothes and equipment. The skis made it onto the flight to Milan. The other bag did not. After arriving in Milan I was assured that the bag would arrive the next day and would be delivered to my hotel that was several hours away in the alps. The bag did arrive the next day to Milan, but it ended up held up in the airport for 3 days because the baggage company only delivers on Wednesday. By Wed, our group had moved to another country and needed the bag delivered to the new country. Trying to arrange for that with Delta was a complete waste of time after spending numerous hours on the phone with them. They never connected my bag to me for the entire 9 days that I was away. They ultimately delivered it to the wrong country. I had to track it down and pay someone to deliver it back to the airport at the end of the trip so that I would be reconnected with my clothes and equipment to go back home with me. I heard a lot of lip service from Delta about how much they valued my platinum medallion status , but it was all lip service and no action on their part. Delta was worthless in making any effort to connect me to my bag, and equipment that I needed for backcountry skiing. Additionally worthless was their compensation, or lack thereof, for making me go 9 days without the clothes and equipment that I needed. If you really need something for your trip I recommend contracting with a 3rd party delivery service company to get your stuff overseas, because you can't count on Delta at all. What a horrible experience. I have booked flights on Delta before when I could have paid less to fly their partners overseas. From now on, I'll be booking those flights with their partners instead and saving money since Delta showed my no loyalty nor benefit to book with Delta instead. I was flying exclusively with Delta. Now, I'm a free agent. Loyalty needs to work both ways, and did not for that trip. My trip ended up miserable due to Delta. too much time on the phones - accomplishing nothing, and very uncomfortable trying to do things with clothes and equipment that were not right nor meant for the experience, since everything else was stuck in never land in my bag."

Our 1 hour layover got cut to 10 minutes to catch a connecting flight at a gate very far from our own. Upon finding out this information we spoke to the flight attendant and asked if they could give notification to the gate that we were still on our way and to inform them about the delay. The response was, hey don't worry about it, you can make it, no need for the call. So my pregnant wife and I were left running to our gate, making it 3 min past the departure time to watch our flight leaving the gate, and no attendant at the counter. At that point we just felt lost, and guess what, had to continue to wait till the attendant returned to the counter only to reply, ""Why didn't they just call? This could have been avoided?"" So at this point I am trying to keep my cool and am directed to the customer service counter. As I arrived at the Delta Customer service counter I am informed that there are no flights left for the night and no connecting flights. She gets us set up for the following day and a hotel accommodation. The customer service agent then gives us the packet and closes up for the night. We then wait for our tram, make it to the hotel just to find out that The reservations were reserved on a different name. And could not be checked in. We were informed by concierge that Delta would not accept the concierge changing the name and I would have to have customer service fax over the changes. I contact customer service who gave me a 40 min wait time before I could speak to a customer service rep, so not only has my pregnant wife had to run through an airport, call in sick for the following day and now have an at least 40 min wait till we can even check in for a flight 5 hours later. I request a call back and am returned a call an hour later just to get the response ""oh that Delta is different than this Delta, and you have to go back to the airport to get this changed. Ok, I figured maybe the rep just doesn't have the knowledge to fix the mistake, but no, after going through management I receive the same excuse even though they were able to pull up my flight information and transaction history. Oh I failed to mention during that 40 min wait time the concierge services were trying to contact Delta services via their vendor line and were getting continually hung up on by their rep line. So now I had to get a shuttle back, for the rep at the airline just for the rep to inform me that the place where my pregnant wife was staying at the moment wasn't even the hotel that my name had been reserved at. After going through the chain of events I had very little sympathy for any excuse that the airline had for trying to change us to a different hotel and was able to get the customer service rep to re-reserve the room in my name. I am writing this currently at the gate to my flight home so this travesty might continue, I figured that this would be enough to portray how much of a terrible experience this is. Oh just to add, my flight home now my wife and I are in non connecting seats and the gate customer service couldn't ""print tickets"" so I had to write down all the information on our receipts from the previous night, she didn't even have the courtesy to do that for me."

My connection flight must have pushed back early because 3 minutes after the time of the flight the plane had already taken off, and failed to wait at all. I was comped a voucher for up to 15$ for food while I had to wait over four hours in the airport for the next flight. This is unacceptable for this kind of treatment, and I will be highly discouraging others from traveling delta in the future. With over 16 hours of total travel time and incredibly poor service on the airline, I am incredibly disappointed."
1392,2,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Rome,March 2019,1,1,1,1,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  New York to Rome. This was the worst flying experience I have ever had. I arrived at the airport 3 hours before my flight. When I went to check in my luggage, a service which cost me $120, I was told that the flight had been canceled and that they would have to reroute me to my destination. This process took them 2 hours. Given their delay and incompetence, I missed that flight and had to go back to the check-in counter. I was told that they couldn't get me on another flight until the next day. I was forced to find a hotel and pay for it on my own. My luggage had been sent on ahead and so I had no change of clothes and no toiletries. The next day I departed as scheduled. On my flight I was not served a meal which I had preordered and the television monitor did not work. It didn't matter because I was not provided with headphones and so I spent the entire 7-hour flight with nothing to do. I was not able to sleep because I was in an aisle seat and the flight attendants were going back and forth and kept bumping into me all night long. When I arrived at my final destination (36 hours late) my luggage had been lost and that took another 40 hours to deliver to me. I requested compensation from the airline several times and was denied. The bottom line is that they simply do not care about their customers. At the very least they should have covered the cost of the hotel and refunded my luggage fee but they chose instead to be greedy and uncaring. Their attitude and lack of service are terrible. I regret having flown with them and in the future I will make every effort to avoid them."
1393,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Pittsburgh,February 2019,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,0,Not Verified ,"  My experience with Delta was terrible. From their staff advising my friend and I to each pay an additional 150 each to arrive one day early, only b/c one letter of my name was wrong on the ticket. Then after paying over 300 we were put on a the most packed airplane I have ever been on, with no water. We sat on the run way over an hour before taking flight and again at the airport, where we were suppose to catch our connecting Delta Flight. My friend and I literally ran through the airport, only to be turned away at the gate and left with a 3 hour lay over. So we spent an extra 300 dollars to not arrive any earlier than we originally planned for. The time we spent at the airport, we could have stayed in Vegas. I also wrote an email explaining in great detail the time of the plane departing and the time we arrived at the gate of our connecting flight- where were turned away. I got a generic email with a 25.00 credit that expired in 2 months! I am most frustrated because I feel like my email was not taken seriously. You can tell when a company actually cares, and that is not what i got from Delta."

So I'm sitting at the ATL airport now and decided to write this review before I forget after spending 2 weeks in Nigeria. I was told by the customer service rep over the phone to inform the check in staff that I'm pregnant. I went to the desk and notified the lady, she made a face like ""why are you telling me?"" I explained that I was told to tell her that so that I can board the plane with the ppl with kids and special needs. She said ""well if u feel like you need to board the plane early!"" She was very rude! Delta is hyped up to be the best airline but the customer service need to improve especially the staff in Atlanta."

1396,2,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Seattle to Orlando,January 2019,3,3,,,1,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Seattle to Orlando. Terrible customer service! We bought our tickets 9 months ag. We paid extra money for comfort class and to sit together since we are flying with a toddler. We were notified via email this morning that they split our party up due to double-booking. I called and spoke with an agent who said that there was nothing that she could do or offer us and that I shouldn't expect to have a flight or have my seats just because I purchased tickets.  Delta, if you overbook a flight, it is your problem and your fault. Not mine. We paid nearly $2000 to fly together in this row of seats. If someone who is flying solo double books one of our seats, then move that person (who is clearly okay with sitting alone). When I suggested this to the agent, she told me that Delta ""doesn't know which passengers are on our planes"" and ""does not have any way of contacting this person when we don't know who they are."" That's either the most negligent form of safety in the world or a complete lie. Either way, completely unacceptable. We've been loyal Skymiles members for years and we are ending our relationship with Delta. Complete disregard for customer service and safety."

You would think that airline would work with you in cases of emergency but unfortunately that is untrue. Me and my husband were trying our hardest to catch a flight because his dad is dying and we wanted to make sure he got home to see him. We missed the check in time by 5 minutes and begged for someone to please let us on the flight. The lady at the desk called but didnt even mention our situation and just said rules are rules and I dont make them. Screw rules when there is someone's life on the line. Is an airline really not willing to help someone out who missed check in by 5 min. So he have to wait until tomorrow morning to fly out and we are praying that his dad can hold on until we arrive. 
1400,5,,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Norfolk ,April 2019,4,5,3,5,5,5,1,1,✅ Trip Verified ," Atlanta to Norfolk. So Delta this is a news flash! Today I got to the airport early to try and get on an earlier flight than my scheduled one because it became important to get home sooner on my weekly commute schedule. Even though there were many seats available, because I had booked a basic economy ticket the agent did not allow me to get on the earlier flight. So I have to stay in ORF airport for a lot of hours and Delta gets to give up the possibility of selling my seat on the later flight because they are unwilling to let a ticketed passenger on an earlier flight that had 20 ish seats empty. Flight after sold out. Totally stupid to do that to me just because I didn’t spend an extra $40 on the initial ticket. You lost potential for an extra $500!"
1401,2,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Boston,April 2019,2,4,2,3,3,2,1,0,Not Verified ,"  What a nightmare! Wish I would have read the reviews prior to my flight because from what I've read my experience appears to be the norm. I would have saved myself from an exhausting and difficult flight experience. This was the worst flight experience by far and I've come to the conclusion from reading the other reviews and my personal experience that customer fairness and customer satisfaction just isn't a priority for Delta Airlines. Had a flight from Baltimore to Boston with a layover in New York. There was severe weather and understandably there were delays. First flight was delayed, 56 mins, 1.5 hours, 5 hours to being cancelled and then diverted to Atlanta instead of New York. I had booked a day in advance for possible problems because I had a special event that I needed to attend the following day, with that being said I was traveling with two other relatives and they split us up by putting me on a flight that departed the same day (late night) which ended up being delayed. The little light in this is the Boarding Agent, she was very helpful in getting my 2 family members on the same flight and had to work alone in resolving multiple ticket issues because Delta had changed peoples flights without their knowledge. Thought we were good, but it gets better, we get off this flight and make it to the gate of the connecting flight and the agent was nowhere to be found. We can see our connecting flight, the agent finally comes to the front and we watch the plane taxiing back and he says ""that plane was boarded 7 minutes ago the doors are closed. They knew you were coming."" So if they knew we were coming on a delayed flight by minutes why were they allowed to leave? He wasn't concerned about our dilemma in the least bit. At this point it was 10:49pm after starting this nightmare at 1:30pm. I asked him to direct us to front reservations. The only other glimmer of light was the Reservation Agent who could only give us a next morning flight, by giving us a hotel voucher because I wasn't trying to spend the night in the airport. Collateral damage seems to be a part of Delta's protocol. It is my intention to never fly this airline again. Most businesses would be out of business if they conducted business in this manor."
1402,6,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Los Angeles,April 2019,3,2,2,5,4,4,3,1,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I don’t complain often, but this is my second ever flying with Delta. I have met some really nice workers that work there who were very helpful. My only issue is, a couple of the flight attendants there and back were rude and seemed as though they didn’t want to be asked for assistance. Also, I look very young. So, I get I have to show my ID often. I highly suggest, the company speaks with their flight attendants about ID’ing a guest before blatantly lying about not serving a drink that’s on the menu and also never coming back. I also asked for soft drinks or snacks and one of the flight attendants looked annoyed that I even asked her. It’s frustrating to get that type of service. As for the rest of the workers, they were great and very welcoming."
1403,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Phoenix via Detroit,April 2019,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," I booked a flight with Delta to leave on 4/19/19 at 9 am, from Chicago to Phoenix. It was a connecting flight with a 30 minute layover in Detroit. Before getting on the plane, I informed the flight attendant of my short layover. I also found out 9 other passengers were going to Phoenix too. I asked politely if she could make an announcement at the end of the flight, so all 10 of us can get up before everyone else stands up.Her response “You better run”! During the duration of the flight, I asked multiple times if they can make the announcement, which they didn’t! Once we landed, we were waiting for about 10 minutes until we got off the plane because of Deltas incompetent flight attendants! Our flight arrived at gate 22 and our flight to Phoenix was departing from gate 74! I and 9 other passengers ran 50 gates down. Once we got to the gate, our plane was still there. I might mention they were still finishing up putting the luggage in. Flight attendant at the desk was there to inform us that they won’t open the door for us, even though they knew we were coming. All of us just stood there out of breath and watched our plane leave. Without being apologetic, she told us the next flight departs at 4:20pm. She was very informed though and mentioned to us that they were having problems due to weather conditions in the east coast. And Delta I must applaud you for how accurate your flight attendants are! Just like she warned us, our flight got delayed to 5:30, 6:30, 7:30 and then 8:30! All 10 of us ended up leaving Detroit at 8:50 and getting to Phoenix at 10:30! If it wasn’t for the flight attendants on the plane, all 10 of us would make it on time and be in Phoenix at 1pm! That 10 minutes (if the flight attendant would just make an announcement) when we were waiting for everyone to get off the plane, would’ve saved us from being stranded at the airport for 8 hours! I guess an announcement is way too much to ask Delta! Our plane left with 10 seats empty when they knew all other flights were getting cancelled. Some passengers from our flight got vouchers and some didn’t! I went to talk to someone at the Deltas help desk and got a privilege of once again speaking to another Deltas courteous flight attendant. She informed me and I’m quoting “you don’t deserve a voucher because it was your fault you didn’t make the flight,” You should’ve ran faster”. Ive asked to speak to the manager and she replied “good luck”. She also refused to give me any badge number, last name and refused to call the manager! After asking random flight attendants at the airport, I finally spoke to a supervisor and someone else that was above him. Both of them told me that I should call Delta. The only problem is that days after I still never got a call back! Delta, how are you allowed to sell connecting flights with 30 min layover when they’re 50 gates apart! Yes, I’ve heard from again very professional Delta flight attendants that I was the one who booked the flight. The problem is, you don’t inform anyone that you have to run 50 gates down while we re booking it. And you definitely don’t inform your costumers of flight attendants that instead of helping passengers, they’re extremely unprofessional and rude! To sum up this trip, Delta thank you for ruining my Easter! Advice: keep your phone handy, because all other passengers I’ve met in my 8hours of being in Detroit, everyone seemed to agree on one thing."

My husband walked up to flight attendant, and asked her if she would let us know when we would be able to change seats because we were assigned different seats. He didn’t noticed it until time of boarding. Which we totally understood this was our mistake. The problem that really got to the both of us was her tone, she basically told him; the best thing he could do is ask someone to switch seats if he wanted to move. Her words wasn’t the problem, it was the tone of her voice and look of annoyance in her face. She later walked up and down the isle without even looking at him. I decided to go ahead and move to seats that were empty, my husband followed. As she was passing beverages she then looked at us; without even acknowledging our move by saying anything that showed slightest concern that we were able to sit together, but said, you do realize you’re sitting in seats that require being able to assistance in case of emergency? Again; nasty tone, no smile or anything to feel like we weren’t annoying her. She then asked if we wanted any beverages but then told the attendant behind her to give it to us! I can’t begin to explain completely how that woman made us feel, and hope she’s made aware that every customer on that flight deserves to be treated with respect and common courtesy!"

I always thought Delta was a good airline, I've been learning lately that's not the case. I understand there can be delays due to weather but there was absolutely no effort on anyone's part to get us (there was a small group needing to connect) on an earlier flight, off the plane quickly or communicate with the gate that we were running late.

We landed from Baltimore after a delay due to “severe weather” but for some reason that “severe weather” didn’t keep my flight to Cancun from leaving Atlanta without approximately 30 passengers that were coming from Baltimore. And one particular customer service rep at the counter decided that it was a good idea to offer a voucher/discount for a hotel to one couple but not other families! Why the discrimination? She also provided the worst flights for us to choose from to make it an even horrible experience. But yet other customers had better flight options. I have never had this experience when flying. The worst customer service! It’s absolutely disappointing and at the same time surprising that I’ve had better contacts with Spirit. Southwest waits for its customers. And no discrimination between first class and those who can’t afford it. Oh and the reps who refused to provide exceptional customer service at the Delta counter in Atlanta and made the experience even worse. So for those who choose to fly using Delta, that’s what you expect to deal with. If you have a layover, not even because of the weather, will they wait for you. They will put you on the worst available flight even though there are better flights with only first class seats available. Delta will not give up their first class seats to you because you paid for economy though “weather” screwed up your layover. They prefer to put you on the most inconvenient flight than to give up their available seats on the next better flight because the only seats left on that flight are first class. We waited to speak to a manager or supervisor but no one showed their face. No one felt it important to come speak to us. "

We then wait on the wrongly boarded plane for 2 more hours as the ground crew leisurely empties the excess fuel from the wrongly boarded plane, because of a weight issue for landing at our destination. They also needed to get our luggage off whatever plane we were supposed to be on in the first place and had to load it on to this wrongly boarded plane that we were currently on. It really seemed as if nobody had any idea what was going on the entire time. My flight was only supposed to be an hour and a half, but took over 5 hours, because of incompetent workers.

In flight fairly standard service, cabin crew not overly observant or attentive, no facility to pre book seats prior to check in at the airport which by today’s standards is archaic and needles to say (as is so often mentioned within numerous reviews elsewhere) no seats available allowing my wife and I to sit together, the original seating arrangement put us 20 rows apart but after 10 minutes of pleading at check in we were permitted to sit a row apart both in the centre seats, it appears some booking sites appear to have preferential terms with Delta and this unfortunate enough not to book thru Delta preferred sites super to get the fodder seats with no concern for family wishing to travel the 7 hour flight together, one gets the sense that this is a regular occurrence with this airline as they do throw you some hope when they see how disappointed you are at the outset of your holiday to find you are sitting 20 rows apart fir the day, knowing we were to be returning 10 days later we asked how we could at least secure return flight seats together but were told we would have to call Delta next week from the states and the member of Delta staff gave us a reference number for the flight which transpired to be a completely bogus reference, after calling 3 times from New York we eventually waited 36 minutes to get connected to an operator who could assist us, eventually after much referencing etc we were first offered the emergency exit row fir $74 but that kind offer was hastily withdrawn when the operator discovered my wife was 53 and so ”too old” to fly in these seats and so it would appear the only option Delta can offer us is our 20 rows apart middle seated again for our return flights. They clearly treat passengers as fodder and have nobody it would seem in their system that can assist passengers who have already paid, they are a joke airline and I would strongly suggest you consider your options very carefully before coming anywhere near these people, just try lodging a query or complaint through their online system, like all there systems deliberately designed to make you give up the will to live before you can complete the laborious pointless questions hurdles, their website is so old design that it crashes if you spend any more than 3 minutes on it forcing you to have to return to the start again, joke service, joke airline, a throwback to 1970’s flying and best consigned to the bin, get your transatlantic tickets elsewhere even if you pay a bit more, at least you will be able to spend the flight with your family rather than the two 400lb snoring strangers I had to endure!!

Original flight time was 10:23pm, received 3 notifications (2 text, 1 email) that the flight time was changed to 11pm. Arrived at the gate at 10:25 to find boarding closed and another couple also at the gate. They spoke with the gate agent who said the time was moved back up - no notification of this. No one was paged. She was to check with her supervisor as the plane was still at the gate and get back to them. She never returned and the plane left us at the gate. Next flight out was 8:15 am the next day. No hotel vouchers because we should have been at the gate for the original boarding time! No accountability at all by anyone at Delta, no accommodation for the trouble. Very poor policy and customer service! I was told the plane started boarding at 10:15, not sure how it was complete and closed within 10 minutes?"

Pretty much all flights on time. FA's were all friendly to very friendly. Boeing 757/A321/737 I flew on had all personal screens with a vast choice of movies and TV series for free. Power plugs on almost all seats (2 in a row of 3 seats) for quick charge.  You can still stream movies and stuff via your cellphone/tablet through the on board wifi. Using messager like Whatsapp is free of charge. The beverage service is also good. On longer flights they usually offer you 2 rounds of nonalcoholic beverages for free. On the 3,5 hour SJO-ATL leg they came through with water twice on top of that. However, food is still a joke. On a 5 hour flight LAX-SJO all you get is a dry small sandwich. While planes, even the older ones look nice and clean I found dirty seat trays a couple of times which is not nice. Bring antibacterial wipes. So you have to eat at the airport before your flight. Overall Delta offers a solid and reliable product."

Several times I asked a staff member about making my connecting flight. I was told she would check. This didn’t happen. When we landed I had 40 min before departure. I asked a staff member about which gate to go to. He told me I could check the screen. He also said if I ran (I’m 71) I could make it. He said the airport was easy to navigate. It was not. He said there were others going on that same flight and the Air France to Cape Town staff knew we were coming. He said they’d hold the flight, not to worry. After I deplaned I couldn’t find the screen so I ran, through security, through shops, onto a tram, asking at other gates where my gate was and was told by 1 person they were too busy. I got someone to tell me the gate number and after running as fast as I could I got to the gate, the plane was there but I was told boarding was closed. 14 hours later I was on my way to Johannesburg, not Cape Town. I connected in Johannesburg for Cape Town after a hassle and going to the Air France office to get problem straightened."

I was traveling with my elderly parents, one of whom struggles physically. We had window seats on our second leg of the flight and we requested aisle seats. When we arrived in Seattle, we approached the ticket counter about getting a wheel chair for my mother on to the plane and they asked our name and had new boarding passes waiting for us and we had wonderful seats in the first 5 rows of seating. We are so grateful for the help from all of your employees. We were weary travelers and they were so kind, helpful and efficient. The plane seemed brand new. The flight attendants were cheerful and so helpful. This was a delightful end to a week of travel. This experience leaves a lasting memory and I look forward to flying Delta in the the future!"

I am pleased with the value for money I get with Delta airlines in first. Check-in at YYZ was quick and friendly and our luggage was tagged priority. YYZ does not have a lounge in the US departures although it could be purchased. We boarded first and were offered a pre-flight drink. Both legs there and back were short so only snack and beverages were offered. Seats were comfortable and FAs were friendly and efficient. ATL is a great airport to transit through and is easy to transfer between flights/terminals and has good lounges. At both MIA and YYZ our luggage was on the belt promptly. Delta first class for this journey was about half of the cost compared to Canadian airlines flying the same route (although they flew direct). When traveling as a family of three, the extra 90 minutes going through ATL was worth the savings. All flight arrived on time and had great service."

The cabin crew were engaging and professional. In terms of service, Comfort+ gets an enhanced snack selection. I wish the choices were more substantial for a 4+ hour flight, but what they offered was good and we could take what we wanted. Did two rounds of full beverage service and a round of water service. LAX - DTW (redeye) - I liked that the cabin crew were so quiet during the flight. I never heard loud voices, and the announcements were limited to initial departure and final descent. Finally - new boarding process. It seems more organized, especially with the pillars. However, two things kind of irked me: 1) Delta created all of these new boarding groups, yet still had and additional three ""special"" (those needing a little extra time, active military and those with children under two). I think one ""special"" boarding will do, and 2) There were no pillars for Main 3 and Basic Economy (last two boarding groups). This, along with the gate agent's announcements, seemed condescending to the passengers in these groups. I know these groups represent passengers in the lower fare categories, but they still paid for the service and really should not be singled out."
1428,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Puerto Vallarta ,March 2019,1,1,,,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  We had planned a quick 4-day getaway thru Expedia with our two kids to Puerto Vallarta for spring break. The flight to Mexico was with Aeromexico (in partnership with Delta). We arrived at the MSP airport the morning of departure and the parking garage was full so we were directed to park at a different airport, which we did, but had to take two light rails and drag two kids and our luggage up and down countless escalators and long corridors before we reached the Delta desk to check in (nearly an hour later). We had checked in online the night before and just had one suitcase to check but due to the parking debacle we were told it was now too late to check in and we were sent to the Delta special services desk. We waited in line there and were eventually told that she couldn’t help us either, that it was too late to check in and since we had booked thru Expedia we were told we had to call them. We found chairs at the entrance to the airport and started calling to see if we could get bumped to the next flight. After time spent on hold, Expedia told us we had to call Aeromexico, which we did but were told that their computers were down and so they would have to call us back. We were continuing to make calls to see if anyone at Delta, Expedia or Aeromexico could help when someone I knew entered the airport thru the entrance we were seated at. We came up with a ‘Hail Mary’ idea of consolidating our luggage into our carry-ons and sent our one big (now empty) suitcase home with her husband, who had just dropped her off at the airport. This allowed us to race thru security (having to dump a couple items we had neglected to remove in the haste of re-packing) and ran thru the airport to our gate, only to have missed the boarding cut-off by 10 minutes. We were sent to the Delta customer service desk and she too said she couldn’t help us because we had booked thru Expedia. So we spent the next three hours on the phone attempting to get on either the next flight out or the same flight the following day. Initially Aeromexico told us that they could rebook us and that we would have to pay an extra $215 per ticket, but no one at Aeromexico seemed capable of completing that task. While my husband was on the phone with them, I was on the phone with Expedia and eventually was connected with a manager who tried to help by speaking with Aeromexico. In the two hours we were on the phone the news kept getting worse. In the end, Aeromexico refused to rebook our flights because even though we called them before we had officially missed the flight, they said that since we “no-showed” they had since forfeited our return flights (which were actually thru Delta) and now, hours later, if they rebooked our flight to Mexico, there weren’t any available flights to get us home. To add insult to injury, they refused to refund any of our $2900 for the flights that they had refused to re-book and wouldn’t give any vouchers or credit for future travel either. Since we were canceling so late, we also had to pay for two of the three hotel nights too. I would not recommend flying with Aeromexico but I’m also disappointed in the service (or lack there of) provided by Delta. Though they partner with Aeromexico and have a help desk in the airport, they did absolutely nothing to help us!"

Boarding was disorganized, all that the gate agents cared about was getting first class on before everyone else. However, once we got onboard, the flight attendants provided great care and were very cheerful. The inflight entertainment was amazing, as there were over 100 movies on a domestic flight, although Delta does charge for headphones (you can bring your own free of charge). The food was your average American pretzels & peanuts, but they also provided cookies, which are by far one of the best free snacks offered on a US carrier. The bathrooms were pretty clean and our bag was on the carousel within 5 minutes. Delta is an above average airline and is not as overpriced as American. Tickets cost us around 250 per passenger round trip."

Our experience with Delta was pretty mixed. Our flights from Frankfurt to Atlanta were not too bad. Food was okay. Ground service was great as Delta has a good boarding process which we really liked. The economy seats were a little bit uncomfortable if you compare them to other airlines. The IFE system has lots of films series and what not, Sadly you cannot adjust the angle of the screen which is not good as it is hard to see anything when the person in front of you pushs the seat back. The second segment from ATL to CUN was also okay and only a short 2hrs flight, same counts for the way back CUN to ATL. Then it all started...for the last segment we thought, lets go comfort and have better experience. We had seats in row 21 (E+F) next to emergency exit. It was horrible cold even with three blankets covering my legs, result of that was/is having a nice cold when arrived home. The blankets are joke btw. Also the ear plugs do not do what they should do. I have not tested the headphones as they have no ANC in economy so i used my own. The food on Comfort plus was exactly the same like standard economy so not worth spending additional money on Comfort.. I still give 5 out of 10 as the rest was okay. Delta wont be my first choice but it was okay, except the fact it was unbelievably cold on the plane especially on that specific seat."

First when boarding 3 times we had to stop Delta representatives from tagging our bags with the wrong tags. When we boarded the flight it was blowing hot air into the cabin. Once the flight began the wifi took an hour to come up and while trying to watch a movie I finally gave up. First the movie shut off and wouldn't restart. The second movie kept freezing and 2 attempts later I gave in. Once we were on the ground the baggage handling crew didn't get not only our bag but also 4 other family's bags off the plane in time to be able to clear customs and make our connecting flight. When we informed the gate representative of the situation they sent us to a help desk that was closed. After raising a little sand we were finally given a supervisor that basically said that they couldn't help us. That security goes home at 8pm and you are just or of luck. Extremely poor service, extremely poorly handled by delta reps on the ground. Not acceptable for a company that proved itself to be worthless and overall not helpful at their national headquarters and main hub of Atlanta."

We were frantic—but she would not let us board! Instead, we waited 6hrs for another flight. Does not make sense why this happened."

I had 10 minutes to make the jump flight due to a slight delay of when we landed. When finally making it to the plane I asked two flight attendants on the plane how long the flight is, one of the guys answered with “hello” in a condensing tone. I responded with the same question, how long is the flight (I was not rude but tired and out of breath), his response with an absolutely rude and condescending smile was “hello”. Then both the lady attendant and male attendant laughed at me and said, boy he’s rude and then laughed again. I was shocked and never did receive an answer to my simple question. My flight from Austin to Salt Lake was a horrible flight. I’m 6’1” and my knees were literally smashed against the seat in front of me; one offering of a beverage for a flight that is just over two hours. I will never fly Delta again.

The reason I booked this flight was because I couldn't afford anything more, however now all the flights are more expensive. now I have tried to rebook for a different weekend and the ticket is 40 dollars more. After trying to figure out how to enter my credit number in online I was lost and frustrated. Called the company and can only do it over the phone, and now was forced to pay an additional 20$ to the 40$ increase already, to a ""main cabin fee"" vs basic economy(which I originally purchased) because it is their policy. After much complaining and speaking with supervisors I was finally given the basic economy price-still 40$ more than my originally purchased ticket. I am grateful for the basic economy price, but frustrated with the entire situation when I feel as a consumer I should have been given a service for the original price I paid in the beginning."

After a frustrating 2 hour delay, many passengers who had to use the restroom but were told to remain in their seats it was really annoying and frustrating.

Only one delay, which was expected, due to snowstorm in Boston. Delta communication regarding this delay was timely and accurate. I realized the evening I arrived home that I had left my Kindle in the seat pocket. The following day I opened a Lost Item Report with the airline. I did not have much hope that my Kindle would be found and returned. I received daily emails from Delta, and after 8 days the email stated that an item matching the one described by me was found. I followed the instructions for the item to be mailed to me. To my delight, I did receive my Kindle back and much quicker than stated in the emails! It is reassuring that an airline would take the time and effort to locate my Kindle and return it to me. This trip was my third in one month's time, the other 2 trips taken with a different major airline. Every one of those other trips resulted in at least a 2 1/2 hour delay for various reasons, some understandable and most not. Lack of communication from the other major airline, only one time was compensation offered, and each delay resulted in doubling the time it should have taken to travel to the destinations. Delta will be my first choice when planning my next travel adventure."

For the round trip, every flight was extremely late in it's boarding. Then, all of a sudden, our last flight got delayed by 3 hours. When we asked why, the Delta rep told us it was because of maintenance that the plane underwent earlier that morning, which apparently pushed everything behind schedule. What makes no sense is the fact that if the maintenance was undertaken in the morning and the schedule pushed back so much, why did it take until 10 minutes before out flight to make us aware of the huge delay? And why was the situation not rectified in any way? We did not receive any kind of compensation at all, and the only recognition of their fault was in one line in an email reading 'Apologies for the inconvenience.'

After google informed me of my impending doom (this information was very hard to find on Delta’s website), I downloaded the Delta app in a panic. Thankfully, of the 21 people on the stand-by list, I was second in line. Surprisingly, there appeared to be 60 open seats. Because I purchased the basic fare, I had no option to upgrade. Why not just assign these open seats to individuals at purchase? Why not be transparent about the robbery of charging $600 for a “normal” fare while tricking those of us who can’t afford that into a “basic” fare that includes the chance of being stranded? Why guarantee me a flight for half of my trip and then leave me hanging in some strange city? This is a despicable way to do business. I will not be flying with Delta again.

I was on the later flight so tried to change to the earlier flight. Would of been charged $75 a ticket to change (me and my wife, two tickets $150) I literally did not have enough money to pay this and asked the ticket agent to help as I’ve switched flights before without being charged (on Delta). She said that it comes down to the day and how busy the flight is, and in her own words “comes down to the ticket agent and if they want to waive that fee or not”. I waited until everyone else was on board and pleaded with the ticket agent to help me out but they drug there feet and “thought about it” and chatted with each other about non work related subjects until it was to late and they closed the doors with me standing there. Bags in hand and 7 open seats on the flight. Absolutely terrible customer service. Not even a word out of her mouth or an apology for it. Just shut the gate and ignored me and went back to chatting with a different coworker."

The seat on this 767 was more comfortable than the one on the A330, though legroom was a bit tight. However, the aircraft looked tired, and the IFE was a bit outdated. Meal service was good, providing this was a domestic flight. The flight departed and arrived on time, but it took longer than normal for our luggage to arrive at the carousel at JFK. Overall, this was a good flight."

Flights are more often on time than late, but when they are late they do not announce it until the last moment or even give wrong information to make it appear that the flight is not as delayed as it is and then they keep pushing official departure time by a couple of minutes at times until they reach the real departure time which makes it very hard to plan anything (connections, business, rides) in a reliable fashion. They will say that the flight won’t take off at 5 but 5.15, at 5.10 they say it will take off at 5.45, at 5.30 they say it will take off at 6, until they finally admit that that departure is delayed by 1.5 hours and it will happen at 6.30. In the meantime you have to change your subsequent plans 5 times due to incorrect information. Food served is extremely unhealthy. Beverages okay with wide variety of options."

However, Delta changed their mileage plan last year making it impossible to get any higher than gold status (downgraded from platinum). This made me start shopping tickets, and I noticed they were about $200 more per ticket than the next cheapest airline for months. I tried to call, and get them to price match so I could justify the $ to stay with the them, but was told they could not match prices unless it was the exact route. For someone who has been with them for so long, I feel unappreciated, and have been flying satisfactorily with American Airlines for the past couple months for much less money. Wish they tried harder to keep me."

First, I was impressed with Delta's new boarding process, which was by far the most organized one I have experienced at a US airport. Onboard, the 2-4-2 configuration was among my preferred one (I purposely booked flights based on the equipment). However, the seat did not seem comfortable (compare to other economy seats I've experienced). Cabin staff were courteous and pleasant. A cold meal (quite good), a separate snack service (though very small), and 3 rounds of beverage service were offered for this 5.5-hour flight; not bad at all. The IFE provided good selections, but no earphone is offered."

Besides the inexperienced fellow passengers who needed constant getting up and down during my flight and who shouted and laughed out loud at films, I had a terrific experience. I gave up on Delta several years ago, but booked a ticket well in advance for an extremely reasonable price. My mileage statement reflected this as I did not get 100% mileage, but it was to be expected. The flight attendants went out of their way to call me by my name, the food was good and served on Alessi service ware with real silverware (plastic cups), the AVOD has an incredible amount of movies and television shows to watch, the FA actually cleaned the toilets, and the seat comfort in premium economy was satisfying enough. We had no delays or drama on either of my journeys to and from the US from Japan. If the price is right, I will consider flying Delta again in the future as I was satisfied and felt it was good value for money."
1466,7,Boeing 767-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Tokyo Narita,January 2019,4,5,4,4,2,4,5,1,✅ Trip Verified ," The overall online experience was awesome. Unlike domestic flights in US, Delta's cabin service on international routes (especially on those operated by its Tokyo Narita hub) is far better than expected. Both main meal and snacks were great. There were a good variety of movies. However, a search function is suggested since it's really hard to find one just by scrolling. The ground service however, could be improved. Majority of airlines operated in Changi airport offers early checkin service which allows passengers to drop their bags 24 hours in advance. It's specifically useful for early morning flights like this one."

When one of the other passengers asked why we didn’t have a zone they basically told her since she bought the cheapest ticket she was boarding last. Worst customer service i have ever experienced. They also forced me to check in my bag and when I told them I had fragile objects in my suitcase, they simple told me, “then take them out.” I have never been more appalled by an airlines service.

Usually don't fly with Delta, but thought to give it a try. My flight was booked for Tuesday, 3pm. Got to the airport, to the gate that was on the screen. The gate doesn't show my flight, shows different flight. We started asking where is our flight information, why our flight is not on the gate screen. First, no Delta representatives were even there, finally few Delta employees showed up, nobody knows what's going on and why our flight is not on the gate's screen. The Delta representative got confused didn't understand what we were asking and multiple people were asking the same. After a while she realized what's going on but wasn't sure why our flight is not there. Then we were told that our flight was delayed by half an hour. After about an hour they told us the flight was delayed by another hour, after another hour the flight was cancelled! So frustrating! It's a short flight from SLC to SJC.. they rebooked us for 3 hours later from a different gate, far from the original. And they don't even know if they are going to make this flight. I have a midterm exam that i must attend for my school. I gave myself enough buffer from arrival to the exam time. Now I'm not gonna make it to my exam! Very stressful!! It's not a long flight (<2 hours) and with no layover. I signed for the skymiles account with Delta.. Now I'll cancel it and will never fly with them again."

Delta dropped the ball so many times over the last 48 hours that I’m seriously considering never using them again. I’m thankful they realized a problem with the plane before we took off, but they were seriously incompetent from that point on. We unboarded the plane around midnight, we’re told that we were on our own to find a hotel (at midnight), but they ended up helping some people secure a hotel, taxi, etc from a different kiosk. We ended up sleeping on a freezing cold concrete floor by the baggage claim, on one of the coldest night Maui has had in 10 years. It was pouring rain and windy as hell. They were actually getting snow on the peaks of Haleakala. We were told to go grab our luggage, but TSA was closed once we got down there, so we weren’t able to go back upstairs in the warm enclosure. Those who stayed up there were given blankets, pillows, and water, but the 6 of us downstairs were left to fend for ourselves. And that’s just we’re the drama began. One thing after another, over and over again, we dealt with issues from the Delta employees. People who didn’t know what they were doing whatsoever. More delays, sending info for the wrong runway, and BS from employees in Utah once we finally landed, 3 hours late, at 2:30 AM. 48 hours of no sleep, rude and ignorant employees, and no info relayed to those of us on the flight. Let’s just say that I’m glad to be home! They need more training on how to deal with these kind of situations, and if you’re going to be able to compensate some, you need to compensate all. "

I was flying back home to Tampa from Chattanooga with connecting flight in Atlanta. The flight out of Chattanooga was delayed that caused me to not get to Atlanta and off the plane until 5:23pm and my flight left at 5:29p. There was 0 communication between anyone to alert the next flight that there were multiple people that were coming from the delayed flight to hold or wait or do something so that we could all make it on the next flight out to Tampa. 27 people waiting on stand by for the next flight out. It's absolutely ridiculous that Delta did nothing to help their passengers get to original flight or help with getting on an additional flight out that was guaranteed a spot. I am beyond irritated with this airline, Southwest would have offered more assistance and help, I'm surprised Delta did not."

Delta Air Lines is by far the worst experience I’ve had in many years of travel. Out of four legs of flights in a round trip, 3 were delayed, one by over an hour. In an attempt to reschedule one of my flights for a more advantageous time, I was told by a very rude gate agent that nothing could be done without being a platinum member. In a phone conversation involving the same issue, the agent hung up on me with no provocation. This airline does not have poor customer service, it has no customer service.

We will never fly Delta again if we can help it. Our luggage was list, however, that wasn’t the problem. How it was handled was the problem. We got the run around a lot while in a foreign country, and are still dealing with things a few weeks later. Supporting businesses that care for their customers is very important to me. Clearly it wasn’t important for Delta. We did have kind personnel on most of the flights, and some of the customer representatives were nice. Unfortunately not all were, but the main issue lies with Delta and their policies and procedures. I wouldn’t recommend Delta to anyone I know."

The plane got delayed from 10:55 pm to 11:30 am the next day. They made all of the passengers sleep in the airport unless they paid for a hotel on their own. After all of the delays the staff managed to mess up my delayed boarding pass and didn’t even book a connecting flight like they told me. I only knew it wasn’t booked because I wasn’t confident and double checked. I will never fly with them again and neither should you!"

We originally booked a flight from BWI to Merida Mexico for my godson's wedding. Delta canceled the flight and a representative from Delta rebooked us on a flight from BWI to Atlanta to Mexico city to merida. When we checked our flight the night before we joked that Delta was offering up to $500 to give up your seat. It was imperative for us to be in Merida by 5 pm for the rehearsal and dinner so that was not an option. On the leg of the flight from Atlanta to mexico city we only had a half hour to get from terminal A to terminal F. Atlanta is a large airport and we had to get from one side to the other. We arrived at the gate 15 minutes prior to departure. The delta rep at the gate said our seats had been sold and we needed to get on another flight. The next flight to Mexico city wasnt until 4 hours later and the flight from mexico city was also much later. Long story short we did not arrive in Merida until 230 am the next day. Needless to say we missed the wedding rehearsal and dinner. We filed a complaint with Delta and their canned response was basically saying that they were disappointed we had a bad experience and sorry their agent was not accommodating and they were forwarding our complaint to customer service. We will never fly Delta again

No extra miles, ride to my hotel, or anything to help me get through the freezing cold weather. By the time I found news of my luggage, everything was closed already. If I didn't already have an account with Delta or if the flights to Vermont was limited, I would definitely choose another Airline.

Our plane took off from Atlanta and made it to Des Moines then was turned around and sent back to Atlanta because of weather. Not Deltas fault at all. But when we got back to Atlanta we were told the flight would be leaving in the morning and they weren’t going to do anything for us so we just had to sleep in the airport. Then the next morning we get on the plane and have to wait for almost an hour because they couldn’t seem to coordinate filling the plane back up with fuel from the previous night! Evidently 8 hours isn’t enough time to put some fuel in an airplane. When we finally made it to Des Moines the 2nd time they told us we couldn’t land again and we were running out of fuel so we could only wait for 45 minutes before we’d have to re route to St Louis. An hour went by and we still couldn’t land so we ended up in Kansas City where they told us we weren’t allowed off the plane. Then it turned into oh you can get off but can’t get back on. Then it was “if we can’t land in Des Moines this time we are going to Atlanta so if you want off get off and we will pull your checked bags.” So we got off and inside the airport we were told to go to ticketing to have our bags pulled from the plane. At ticketing we were told to go to the baggage office. At the baggage office we were told “sorry you aren’t getting your bags. They’ll be wherever the plane ends up.” Which at this time was looking like it was going to be Atlanta. So naturally we went back to the plane where they told us sorry you already got off and there’s no way we can get you your bag. Delta has been nothing but horrible and unorganized through this whole thing and never has been able to help us out or do anything for us. I will never fly Delta again.

The stewardess was unpleasant, not only ordered us back to our assigned seats but also made several others move, even just across the aisle. What was also interesting is I asked her name and she pulled her smock/jacket over where I could see her badge, reached down and tucked the badge completely out of reach. I moved one seat back so my daughter and I could each have separate rows and she made me move back “someone is sitting in that seat” which of course was a lie as no one boarded.

1486,6,A350,Business,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Detroit ,January 2019,3,4,4,4,3,4,2,1,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I've flown Delta's new A350 at least 8 times in the past year on transatlantic and transpacific routes from Detroit to China and Europe. I am not impressed with Delta's new flagship. In economy class, the aisles are very narrow and you are constantly getting bumped by flight attendants and passengers if you're in the aisle seat. Seats themselves are narrower than on other Delta aircraft, although legroom is adequate. The number of bathrooms in economy is seriously inadequate. Most disturbing, though, is the quality of the interior. It is very evident that costs were cut, as things are breaking down quickly. On this current flight, the window shade was stuck in the closed position as it looked like it was off-track. On another flight, it was a broken lavatory door. On a third flight, the lavatory light didn't work so you had to use the facility in total darkness. And most annoying, the entertainment system didn't work on yet another flight so all passengers were out of luck, no compensation was offered. I'm a Delta Platinum Medallion member and at the point where I'm purposely seeking out either A330 or 777 aircraft on my frequent trips to Europe where possible. Those older aircraft are more spacious and comfortable, and their interior fittings much more durable and reliable. It will be a sad day when the A350 replaces these other aircraft unless Delta does something to improve it."

I am traveling on Delta more frequently and noticing continuing improvements. On these non stop flights we had two runs of beverages and snacks service - four choices from peanuts, Kind bar, cookies and pretzel mix! Attendants helped with stashing bags and winter jackets into overhead compartments. Personal entertainment screens were easy to use - a good selection of current movies. On the way out, they had no earphones to give out and I had not brought my own - so missed out on the entertainment. On the return, head phones were sold for two dollars! Both arrivals were ahead of schedule. Easy, comfortable trip from NYC to SLC in larger aircraft. Delta is the best option for this route."

1489,1,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Salt Lake City,October 2018,2,1,1,1,1,3,1,0,Not Verified ,"  My husband and I had flown Delta to Seattle for holiday. I had previously flown Delta and loved the airline and had often paid more to book with Delta. But,I hadn't traveled via air for about 3 years so this trip was a shocker. The day of our return flight was foggy earlier in the day. Flights had been delayed earlier but not bad and I had flown in much worse fog before. Our flight was in the evening and it hadn't been foggy for at least 6 hours. However, about an hour before our departure Delta canceled a few flights including ours. They rebooked us on a flight leaving at about 11am the next morning and handed us meal vouchers that only covered a basic Subway sandwich with old browning veges. We asked the Delta agent for help and were booked on a flight that was leaving that night but the agent said it was weird because only about 5 other passengers were booked. We thought that was great of Delta to open another flight and expected the flight to fill quickly with the other stranded passengers. But a few minutes later we saw a man with a Delta badge approach the agent and tell her the flight was only to transport a pilot and co pilot with a full sized empty plane to salt lake city (our destination) and no passengers were allowed because there wasn't a flight crew.  Why was that flight allowed to leave and not ours? Why didn't Delta scramble and come up with a crew for that flight!? What a waste. I'm not a crier, especially in public but I couldn't hold back the tears and it's not like there is anywhere secluded to go in an airport for privacy. So my husband and I had to stay the night in the airport and watched for openings on earlier flights. Thankfully we found a flight out at about 6am but we were up all night hungry, exhausted and I was completely humiliated. I had also called Delta's customer service asking for help but they said to talk with the agent at the airport. It was especially important for us to get back to Salt Lake because I had a surgery consultation at 10am in Salt Lake, that I had been waiting about 5 months for. We went straight from the airport to the appointment disheveled and gross. Ironically my appointment was for my foot which was swollen like a melon after sitting in the airport for over 12 hours. I used to recommend Delta to everyone but they've changed. I won't fly Delta and do yourself a favor and choose an airline that at least pretends to care."
1490,1,,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Jackson,January 2019,,,,,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,  Flight was delayed leaving Birmingham and We were told multiple times by the flight crew that we would make our flights. My son was on my connecting flight in Atlanta and he told the gate agent we were on the ground and that I had his heart medication. I ran to the plane and the door was shut a minute before I got there which was Still prior to when the flight was scheduled to leave. The gate agent rudely told me that if I flew more often I would understand the flight rules to close the door 10 minutes before departure time. I am a silver delta member and have flown Delta for over 25 years. Even when I had choices on other airlines I would do my best to select Delta over American. That now has obviously changed. This was the worst experience I have ever experienced with Delta or any other airline. I am truly disappointed.
1491,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Newark,January 2019,,,,,5,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I (possibly Delta) made a mistake booking a flight. I was looking to go to NJ for my aunt's funeral on 1/22/ to 1/24/2019. I never booked that flight. I was also looking to book a flight for 2/1/2019 to Orlando for my nephew's birthday. I thought I booked that flight. Today, my niece asked me to send her my flight information, and when I went to do so, I realized my trip is to NJ, not Orlando. I called Delta and explained the mistake. I booked this 4 days ago. Delta won't do anything. So that's $416 lost. No refund, no credit, no partial credit. Now the flights to Orlando are much higher-at least on Delta. I am a Skymiles member as well as a Skymiles credit card holder. That does not mean much to Delta. My husband, a Platinum member, insists we fly Delta even when the flights are more money. I suppose we will be taking some separate flights in the future. "

Not only were none of their representives helpful when it came to the multiple re-routings of our gate, our flight was delayed 12 hours and no one could help us figure out our next flight time or where we would be sleeping for the night. Now that we are finally on the plane after waiting 12 hours and 34 min, there are technical difficulties and we will have to unboard the plane. I can not emphasize more how disappointing this airline experience has been."

My luggage was checked all the way through to my final destination, San Diego. But my luggage from the UK did not make it to San Diego. There were several of us flying the exact UK to Vegas to San Diego flight and none of us had our luggage in San Diego. At the lost/delayed baggage office they took our details and they told us that the bag would be delivered to my house by 11pm that night. Frankly I was really sceptical but the bag was delivered that night by 11 pm, just as promised. I was really impressed. At the end of day, it was only a tiny inconvenience and they really did exactly what they said they would do. Things can happen at 1st port of entry into the USA which can cause onward baggage delays (like government shutdown, for instance). That’s not the airline’s fault, but what they do after something like this, is what really counts. And Delta came through!"

Staff of Delta at both airports were surprised that I had to pay and I was the only passenger paying for my first bag. The lively lady in Kansas even went to ask her supervisor. So Delta allows nasty edreams to do this? I paid 1300.00 for my ticket so not cheap. Will never fly Delta again and want you all to check this airline before you book

Due to the bad weather, the flight departure got delayed and I was obviously late to catch the next flight in Michigan. I checked with Delta support and they gave me a 20% coupon for a hotel and booked my flight the next day. So, which means I had to pay for all the expenses including transport to go the hotel, food, and hotel charge with 20% discount. They only mentioned they cannot do anything if they delay the departure time because of the weather. This is highly disappointing. I will never travel with Delta again and will not recommend to my friends too. Worst management of all flights."

If I’m buying a few months in advance and the tickets were bought together, then the airline should have seated us together."

1500,1,A330-200,Business,Business Class,New York JFK to London,October 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  New York JFK to London. Delta Air Lines are supposed to be an American flag carrier, and they promote their Delta One business class product as a premier class. First, the Delta Lounge at JFK is nothing short of disgusting. The lounge itself is shabby, and the queue to the bar was massive. Upon finally getting to the bar, the staff try to charge you for the drinks. The food, (help yourself), is truly of such poor quality you would not feed to your dog. Served on paper bowls, from school meal-esque vats, of some kind of watery curry on boiled rice. The flight itself was dreadful, onboard some ancient, Airbus 330-200, presumably inherited from USAir. Terrible crew, who merely served the meal as quickly as possible, and then disappeared to the galley. The meal, per se, was ghastly. I have flown American Airlines, British Airways, and Virgin Atlantic trans-Atlantic, and Delta Airlines set the new low standard; not Business Class, but no class whatsoever. Delta treat their passengers with contempt, by offering this rubbish service. The seat comfort was unbearable too."

I had not flown Delta for over 20 years, and only did so due to the Virgin Atlantic code share. I was intrigued to try their much vaunted Delta One business class. The aircraft was an old B-767-300, which was in awful shape. The so-called business class was atrocious, and must be at least 20 years out of date. I thought British Airways Club Class was bad, but this was worse. The food onboard was inedible, and the wine selection poor. The ONLY good thing about Delta Airlines, was the use of the Virgin Atlantic Upper Class lounge at Heathrow. Other than that, there was nothing to commend about this flight, or indeed this airline. Why to American carriers persist with such ancient aircraft trans-Atlantic, and their incredibly uncomfortable business class seats. "

I have had a terrible experience flying with this airline. I have traveled all over and Delta is the worst! Where do I start? Purchased tickets with customer service by phone asked for 2 seats right beside each other and specifically asked how many pieces of luggage each passenger can check in? The sales agent responded 2 bags each for first class! The next day we went to the Delta counter to board our flight and the counter agent only said that we were aloud 1 bag to Key West. Had to leave a piece of luggage the airport! Boarded the plane to find out that our seats were not together! Landed at Atlanta airport to eventually find out that our connecting flight was cancelled! Had to get a taxi to a hotel that was discounted and not paid and only having the clothes that we were wearing and nothing else! We left at 3:00am to catch our flight for 5:30am! The Delta agents advised us that we will not receive new boarding passes and that we will have to use our existing boarding passes from the day before, needless to say I had a terrible experience with security because our boarding passes were for yesterday. I finally boarded the plane to find out that the piolets did not receive to necessary paperwork to fly to Key West! We waited 1 hour for someone to hand deliver the paperwork while on the runway. Finally landed in Key West to find out that my luggage and clothing was soaked! Still having issues with baggage claims. They rejected my claim stating that the verbal claim was put in Dec 2nd 2018 when I purchased my tickets December 19th and actually did not land in Key West till Dec 21st when I called about my luggage. Spoke to an escalation manager and they could not believe the inept the claim department is."

Check in staff at all airports were excellent, professional and helpful (including Dulles where we started from). Boarding was done in an organized way. We bought our tickets online and it was not clear that we had to pay extra for each bag. Two flights (Dulles to Atlanta and Atlanta to Guatemala just before Christmas) were seriously overbooked and that contributed to significant delays. Air steward conduct was mixed. On the way there, all the stewards were friendly and courteous. On the way back from Guatemala city, the male steward in economy was grumpy and unhelpful. The final straw was near and of flight when he trapped me in a by now dirty bathroom with urine on floor by not moving his beverage-snacks cart and continuing to unload his trays. When he continued unloading, I insisted he move his cart and let me out. Customers should not have to demand to be allowed out of dirty bathrooms. There was no apology. The other airline stewards were not polite or friendly when we disembarked at Atlanta. One Asian stewardess was kind to our daughter though and gave her extra cookies as she was hungry. However, on the next flight from Atlanta to Baltimore all the stewards in both first class and economy were very gracious to economy passengers as well. Food was terrible on all flights. I have never experienced international flights with such poor food options (poor quality cookies and snacks). We could only buy a box of decent snacks on one flight. Food options definitely need to be vastly improved especially on international flights. Overall, much to be commended but also much to be improved."

When we boarded to our surprise it was a Delta Air Lines Plane and we were given seating grade equivalent to Virgin`s Economy X. Not what we paid for. The Service is very low standard compered to Virgin`s Premium Economy. Firstly the pillow had dirty marks and hair all over it, but they were able to find me a clean one. The seats are narrower than Virgin`s Premium Economy. The hostess admitted she did not know the difference between the food packages and was handing out different ones to what passengers asked for. She rips them open to see & check if she got the right one. I got a ripped open one, no bother complaining. The bread rolls they brought around were literally rock cakes. Coffee served was cold and to get anything extra to drink was very difficult. When the hostess finally brought some water around she split it over me.  Every seat is supposed to have a travel pack and mine missed out, no big deal but just part of the low grade service and care. The pocket that holds the instructions etc, still had the previous passengers rubbish. No Do Not Wake Signs as other Airlines have, so when you take off at 10.45 pm you do not really want to be disturbed 4-5 hours later, but Delta does. I suggest Delta Airlines stick to domestic travel in USA & Canada what they do good at, But with International Travel their service including Staff, Seating, Passenger Comforts, Quality of Food is flat out getting 1 Star. Warning : Check who you book with and make sure you are not transferred to Delta Air lines."

Flight delayed in Springfield 7 times. First explanation was a weather issue then changed to a maintenance issue then to a crew timed out issue at which point it became obvious it was nothing more than a lying issue. Connecting flight in Atlanta leaves on time at 10:29 pm, unfortunately we do not arrive until 11:30 pm. Directed to 3 different agent locations then to Baggage Claim area. Approximately 150 people standing in line at midnight after being stranded by Delta. After 2 hrs of standing we are close enough to make out the Delta employee stating that Delta will rebook your flight and nothing more. Someone asked about overnight accommodations and was told there were plenty of chairs in the terminal. Another person asked for a meal voucher and was told Delta does not provide meal vouchers. It was suggested that if anyone got a hotel room they could try to apply for up to $100 in reimbursement after the first of the year. After watching the Delta agents treatment of the customers in front of them and twice hearing an agent tell a customer they did not like their attitude and would have them arrested we exited the line. I am not adept at kissing someone's butt while they treat me like an animal and it had become apparent that Delta's agents were fully aware that passengers have no legal recourse against Delta and they did not hesitate to pass that along with a heaping serving of disdain and arrogance. During this fine example of ""Special Services"" Delta continued to be consistent with the emails telling me how sorry they were for the delay and how they care about their customers. New flight leaving 8:55 am next day. Delayed twice because the Flight attendants were reported by the gate attendant at 8:45 am as being in the airport but did not show up at the gate until after 9:30. Possibly they were in time out like the ones the day before. All in all our 6 hour flight only took 32 hrs to complete and the depths of Delta's incessantly repeated ""The most important connections we make aren't between places. They're between people"" really applies."

They did not assign us any seats upfront. Checked in very early online but could not pick our seat. At the airport, the Delta airline agent told me that Economy cannot pick their seats. You would need to wait and as we are boarding the plane, they assigned us the seats and we were seated at the very end of the plane where the rows do not recline back because they are positioned against the wall. This seating craziness is unheard of. You either give the passengers the first come first serve like Southwest or allow people to checking online and choose whatever is available at the time they are. On both flights of this trip they also checked in our carry on at the boarding because they say they are running out of space for carry on and the plane carry on space seemed to have available space when the plane door was closed."

We made it to the gate with 10 minutes before take off. Plane at the gate and no agent around. That is the first issue. Why is no one at the gate? I have to track down an agent. They should have been waiting for at arrival. Next she speaks with the gate agent while he is closing the door. I am a customer service manager, this would not be at all acceptable in my industry.

We weren't offered to stay in a hotel close by and I even had to ask the staff for something to eat. We landed in Atlanta around 3am and were charged a no show fee at the hotel. We also had to pay for the transport to the hotel as airport shuttles don't run at this time. AF customer service that's supposed to take care of that refused to compensate us as it is a US company operating a US flight. Doesn't matter that we booked from Air France. Is it really our problem that they delegate the flight to a partner? Even scarier: that ""technical"" issue was apparently a leak that prevented the plane to take off, however the plane just flew from ATL. So, there's no customer service but there's also no maintenance!? Cheap ass airline we will never fly again."

Not longer than four seconds after I came up, the other agent proceeded to cut off our conversation and almost yelled at my face, ""I already told you many times we have to help all higher class guests before you, why do you keep asking."" And let's not mention customer service yet, even on the normal basis, politeness between two humans, she does not have! A customer does not deserve basic polite interaction between humans, because of economy class? Thanks very much Delta, I will most likely not fly with you again to avoid headaches like this."

At the end of the flight, flight attendants came through the main cabin thanking passengers for flying Delta and handing out candy. The experience was very nice and a cut above the Air France flight we had from FRA to CDG to connect with this flight. In-flight experience noticeably better than other legacy carriers I have flown in the past year. The flights to FRA (RDU-DTW then DTW-FRA) were also good.

1525,1,,Couple Leisure,First Class,Detroit to Salt Lake City,December 2018,2,5,,2,3,,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  We split our time between France and US. So we fly quite often between the two, and we also travel a lot for leisure. So we decided to use around the world tickets, the advantage being it allows you to make stops, change flight schedules etc. without penalties. Additionally, we opted to go Business class with 1st class flights with the latter being carriers who do not have business class. There is an unspoken expectation that if you upgrade, you will be allowed to use the lounge. Long story short, wrong. We flew from Paris to Detroit. Stopped in Detroit, MI for a few days, then flew to Reno, NV. We were able to use the business lounge in Paris, but not able to use the business lounge in Detroit, stating that we could only use it if we continue on to Reno on the same day. Or basically flying continuously around the world? WTF? I am not trying to be entitled or ask for special treatment, but when you pay for business or first class tickets, there is an expectation that you can use the lounges. So I tweeted to Delta and they asked me to PM them with my complaint/feedback. Response I got, it’s basically their policy, and they’re not making exceptions. Again, I was not asking for special treatment nor do I feel as though I am entitled, but there is an expectation when you pay 3-times that of economy. I write this to let other’s know, because you have choices for around the world tickets. I like flying business because, call it paranoia, but I like being at the airport early so as not to miss my flight, and having the comfort of these lounges. Delta really needs to look at their “around the world policy” as it relates to usage of their lounge. This is the response I got from Delta. “Thanks for your patience, Randy. I have further reviewed policies and we strongly enforce these guidelines. Please know we regret the disappointment as we value your business and choice of airline. Applying for the Delta American Express Card or buying a Membership is also another option. You can find further details on the link I provided for you earlier. *AST” If using lounges is important to you, then please check the individual airlines policies first."

Just a long stay in the airport with a ""too bad, so sad attitude by staff"". Also destroyed my luggage in such a way to completely remove an entire corner. I will never ever use this airline again.

1534,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Minneapolis ,November 2018,1,3,3,,1,3,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ," This airline severely mishandled the winter storm that came in. For starters, a message notifying of my delayed flight was not sent until I was on my way to the airport, a trip about 1.5 hours with the road conditions. I arrived about 1.5 hours before my flight departed, so this was less than a 3 hour window. About half way to the airport, I was notified of a 2 hour delay. This was understandable given the conditions. However, Delta kept pushing back the flight at that point in 1 and 0.5 hour increments all the way until 5:40. In this time, all I could do was wait. While Delta did provide food for the many people waiting, it certainly was not very good (cheap pizza and water) and not enough for everyone. They even ran out of plates for people. Finally, when the plane arrived, the passengers were told that the crew could no longer work, and we were forced to wait another 3.5 hours while they tried to find a crew. Given they knew about this storm and the delay, they should have been aware of the crew's inability to work more hours and have a standby crew ready. After finally boarding the plane at 9pm, almost 12 hours after arriving at the airport, the passengers learned we still didn't have a co-pilot and were forced to wait another 1.5 hours. Even after finally landing it took an additional 10 minutes than normal because there were problems getting the hallway for people to get off to work. Overall these delays cost me over 13 hours, and I missed a class and a fairly important meeting. This management is inexcusable by an airline, and now I know to avoid flying Delta when possible."

I realize this happens from time to, but expect when it does for it to be handled professionally. I have never seen such inadequate and unprofessional management of what one would assume to be a simple situation. Repeatedly my Delta agent simply ignored my requests for information related what Delta was offering to cover and what they were denying—I still have no idea what exactly is being covered. Furthermore, the agent ignored my requests for a phone call--when she final addressed the request she said the time difference was too great despite my offering to take the call at any time no matter how inconvenient it was for me. I had to drive the entire conversation with the agent frequently taking over a week to get back to me even after multiple follow-up emails from my end. I spent about 15 hours of my own time handling this situation and in the end Delta provided me with a $250 voucher for the $2,000+ ticket and is covering 75% of my cost and the damage to my personal things. If Delta actively employees a strategy of confusion and incompetence to reduce costs, they nailed this case."

During my most recent trip, all three of my flights were delayed. One was on account of weather, which was not Delta’s fault. Telling me and everyone else with connecting flights that we had been “rebooked” when in fact we had not was certainly delta’s fault. They did this for the other two delays that were undoubtedly delta’s doing and had nothing to do with weather. Each leg involved hours upon hours of trying to find a delta phone operator who felt like rebooking my flight. When I finally made it to my destination, I was informed that delta had sent my bags (which would have come in handy for my two-week vacation) the opposite direction all the way back to Detroit.

We kept being told “5-10 mins”. Then we find out our connecting flight had been cancelled. Delta felt they did us a favor by rebooking a flight for us- that went out the following day - late evening - with another layover. After several errors on Delta’s customer service to book us a better flight- we finally thought we were on our way home after 6 hours - for that flight to also keep getting delayed. All Delta flights were extremely delayed. Some because they were “waiting on the flight crew to arrive”.

I could not make the birthday dinner party with the other flight offered and asked for a refund and to be returned home.

Delta: 1) did not communicate with itself about the connecting flight being delayed. 2) when explicitly asked to notify the gate refused to do so. 3) when I asked to go home and be refunded was told I had to buy my own ticket home and no refund so it is cheaper for me to sit here in the airport, fly to St. Louis, then fly back to Toronto."

Suffice it to say the following that occurred to us, a family who was on a trip that we saved thousands for with a terminally ill family member trying to make memories To have it ruined at the last minute and have bad memories of it is extremely unacceptable.  First was called by Delta the partner in the flight with KLM, called and told us they were changing our flight with a 24 hr lay over ""as crew couldn't find a place to stay for the night in Panama City due to the storm"". Never mind that we looked up and found several places on the beach. In any event, this meant we would have to add another day of expense and change our flights to 5:55 AM, meaning we also lost all ability to submit our VAT refunds among other things, but the worst was yet to come. On checking in the 'lady' at the gate told us we could not carry on our policy size and weight carry on bags, as the ""flight was full"", yet the bags had important medical equipment, medicines and fragile expensive goods that we had no ability to lock up as we were told the bags would be able to be carried on. If the bags were lost or damaged replacing the equipment and meds would be extremely hard even once back home. The worst part-every other passenger behind us and at other gates for the same flight were being allowed to carry on their bags as advertised. CWhen confronted about why this was the case the gate attendant told us ""call direct if you like its in the policy fine print, we can do this to you"" She then became belligerent and gave one word answers, didnt look at us and said 'next"". When I tried to ask if wheelchair assistance had been confirmed, she spouted off a series of gate numbers where I could go ask for a wheelchair, and rushed us out of line. I then returned to the gate as her info wasn't sufficient, and asked another gate attendant who simply stuck her finger in the air and said ""over there somewhere"" and didn't even look at us.  Wheelchair assistance either wasn't at the gates or was very late and we had short connect flights and couldn't just hope it showed up. My son and wife  had to almost carry me at a run to the next gate. The only connection this didn't happen at was Atlanta and then only because we we hunted down a wheelchair attendant when ours wasn't there. The gate attendants were disrespectful, dismissive, and left us genuinely concerned given my inability to walk the distances due to legitimate neurological disease for which I carried medical proof- They forced us to check bags that others were carrying on board -passengers of the same ticket class as us. In fact nearly every other passenger boarding had their bags, The only difference in us and other passengers. -we had a disabled passenger. Thanks KLM for taking what should have been a good memory for our family with thousands of dollars of expense and sending my family home stressed, insulted, worried and upset. Never again."

Except this last time. My daughter has a peanut allergy and I made sure to tell the lady at the front desk before we boarded the plane. She even let me board early to clean my 3 year olds area to prevent any reaction to the peanuts. She also told me that I would have nothing to worry about and they wouldn’t serve peanuts on the plane. I even told the flight attendants as I got on the plane. But, as the flight attendants are coming by with snacks I over heard her ask the lady across from me if she wanted peanuts. I then asked her if she was serving them. She turned red and realized she messed up. Peanut allergies are very serious. She came back and told me they would give me a 25 dollar Visa card to come to my email for the inconvenience. I think it was totally not responsible of the entire staff working considering I told everyone before boarding the plane."

But then Delta delayed our connecting flight causing us to arrive late to Atlanta, then they rescheduled, and rescheduled, and rescheduled, and changed the gate, and changed the gate, leaving us stranded wandering around Atlanta while they figured out they couldn't get us to our destination. After a day stuck in the Atlanta airport we finally manged to catch a redeye back to DC, only to have them lose all of our bags in the process.

Buy an expensive ticket or be prepared for your punishment! I have flown in a more comfortable fairground ride. You will be crammed with a seat pitch lower than that of a standard UK domestic flight. The seats are hard and forget any thoughts of sleeping if you are flying home from the USA. If you don’t buy an expensive seat everyone who boards ahead of you will ram the aisles so be prepared for a bore of a boarding process. Forget overhead locker space as Premium economy holders occupy the overhead lockers back to the wings. The staff are excellent with a good sense of humour and I had a good joke with them about how passengers are treated at ‘this end’ of the airplane. I accept that I paid a low fare and can expect cattle class but you will literally have less space than EU regulations require cattle to be afforded as they are transported to the abattoir. The worst part is that I actually booked a Virgin flight but apparently as a Virgin Partner its the luck of the drawer.

That makes a perfect trifecta for the year, London, Paris and Narita/Singapore. All with run down 767's, full of flat hard cushions, broken USB ports, glitchy touch screens that take you 15 minutes to select a movie. Last week they only had enough meals for half of coach. They blamed it on the contractor who provides the meals, although it could have been caught if they had checked it. Their inability to board a flight on time probably precludes the Flight Attendants from being able to double check the ""Contractors"". Thank goodness for their partner airlines, like KLM, they have newer planes, and are much more pleasant to fly. I see no value in being a Diamond Medallion on Delta Airlines.

It (and 767 in general) has the best economy seating arrangement of 2-3-2. However, the aircraft is loud and the overhead bins are small. IFE on this particular aircraft was good, with a nice selection of movies (this has been my positive impression about Delta). Food and service were decent, as expected from the airline. My flight was diverted due to bad weather in NYC (sounds familiar?), and this, of course, was not the airline's fault. In fact, the crew did a good job updating us about status and showed effort to get us to JFK as fast as they could."
1570,7,Boeing 767-400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Frankfurt,July 2018,5,4,4,3,1,5,3,1,✅ Trip Verified ,"  New York JFK to Frankfurt. When I left the Sky Club in JFK terminal 4 and headed to the nearby gate roughly 10 minutes before boarding, I got a text from Delta that the departure gate was changed. It was a non-issue unless the new gate was in terminal 2, and the only way to get there was by bus. To make things more confusing, the text did not advise me where I could take the bus, which departed from another gate. When I made to T2, an old, small and overcrowding facility, the flight was delayed because they needed to transfer the food, which had already been loaded to the original aircraft at the original gate, to the new aircraft (?). I ended up arriving at Frankfurt late, and the delay was not caused by weather or any technical issue. Reading many reviews here, one can easily notice that many complains about US carriers are about delays and how the airlines handle the situation, and that was what exactly happened here with Delta. The 767 perhaps has the best economy class seating arrangement, with only 1 per row that is not either a window or an aisle seat. The 767-400 used for my flight had the old version of IFE which was not that great (Delta's 767-300ER had better, newer IFE). I paid for wifi (the free version never works) and it worked fine. Service and food were fine. Crew distributed bottle water after meal (without us asking) which I think was a nice touch for us to stay hydrated throughout the flight. Overall, without the ground service issue, Delta is a pleasant airline to fly with."

The attendants were humorous and made conversation with those of us flying which made a big difference (ex: joking and having character.) There were a few snack choices, and the plane ride was smooth. It was a bit more expensive than AA, but I'd use Delta again for these reasons! Secondary flight was a few minutes delayed, but that's understandable (there was bad weather in ATL.)

I was assured by the lady who checks in bags that I’d be able to call after my trip and get my refund. I was not able to do this when I called in. They said that according to their systems I had apparently checked in a bag. This was incorrect. They then attempted to hand me off to their baggage handling service line to get more baggage history. Shouldn’t getting their things together correctly be their job? The flight itself was horrible. I checked in a day early to ensure me and my fiancé had seats together and when the actual flight came they tried to switch my seat without asking me or even telling me that my seat had changed. They had even threatened to kick me off the flight. What for? Their mistake? Worst airline I have ever flown with.

After begrudgingly taking our drink orders in first class the beverages were slammed on our trays without a please or thank you. This is a 5.5 hour flight and for most of it the FA was nowhere to be seen. We finally found her sitting in a comfort seat in 17A. After 3 hours of being thirsty I finally walked to economy class and asked the FAs there for sodas. Even after telling then that we had no service in 1st class I was just given a ""oh sorry"" which did me no good. The FA further was unable to give the correct coats (from coat check) back to the proper passengers because it would have required her actually labeling them or tracking them. This woman clearly did not want to do her job. She works in the wrong industry and gives Delta a bad name. She was based out of LA and had the attitude to go with it. Horrible service!"

First leg of the outbound was delayed on the tarmac due to flow control into Delta's Minneapolis hub, where I was to transfer. Apparently this is not uncommon, so one wonders if the airline should adjust its schedule accordingly -- perhaps by disallowing short layovers -- which is the reason for an imperfect score. I arrived at MSP about 20 minutes before my connecting flight was scheduled to depart. The Delta app said my gate was a 12-minute walk. However, I'd gate-checked my bag, so I was still in jeopardy of missing the connection. When I stepped off the plane I was met in the jetway by a Delta staffer who solved all my problems by escorting me to a car on the tarmac, where we grabbed my bag from the baggage handler, and shot off through a tunnel under the C and G concourses, directly to my connection. I had 10-15 minutes to spare. To top off this good experience, the Asian vegetarian meal they served was restaurant-quality -- delicious and healthy. Good job, Delta.

Afterwards I had an ice cream which I returned as well as it did not taste like vanille but like chemicals. The next meal, ""breakfast"" was cereals (too sweet) or a tortilla. I desided to take the tortilla. However, that was something made of egg powder. It was just horrible. One pays a lot to travel business class, for that money I at least expect a tasty meal. Also the personnel on my way in economy were much friendlier than the attendents in the business class who were arrogant and not very friendly.

I don't know how people, particularly anyone over 6 feet tall, routinely fly on Delta. Their jets have the worst—least—amount of legroom of any airline I've flown. I'm 6'4"" with long legs, and the seat I was in had just enough space behind the seat in front of it to allow me to wedge my legs into the space, but I could not move them side to side because of the people beside me. Consequently, I had to sit for 2 hours with my knees jammed up against the seat in front of me, with all the obvious discomfort you can imagine. Luckily, the lady in front of me did not recline her seat. That would have been an even greater amount of pain. Seriously, why does Delta pack these seats so closely together? Do they not realize there are people out there taller than 5-1/2 feet? They should make one-third of the rows with larger leg room, and reserve these seats for people of a minimum height. Delta is my last resort for flying, and the only reason I had to settle for this flight was it was the only direct flight option for me. I guess I should stick to American and just accept the added hassle of connecting flights and layovers just to get a more comfortable ride. Come on, Delta!"

Denied when we checked in, denied when we spoke to the crew at our layover stop, and denied by customer service on the phone; and that was just the state-side experience. When on our international leg, our flight was originally overbooked; we went out of our way to volunteer for a later flight. The itinerary was lined up and at the last second, the staff decided they did NOT need us to switch. So there we were, having gone to the trouble of adjusting our arrival plans, only to rush to re-arrange them in the five minutes before we took off for the states. Funny how they had no trouble adjusting our itinerary twice for their own needs. As I write this, that homebound flight is leaving, with empty seats, and two fully dissatisfied customers sitting in the lobby who will forevermore go out of their way to fly anything but Delta."

Where do I start. I show up to PDX at 3:00am to check in for a 6:00am departure (I’m an early bird). I wait until 4:30am and ask when Delta reps are supposed to be out. That was supposed to happen at 4am. So, that’s strike one. Not out until 4:45am where there’s a line of at least 30 people. First flight to SLC was fine. The flight staff I liked, they were the only ones I liked. Super short layover at SLC. Get on at SLC, the new staff made a big deal about a pet and made sure I knew not to remove the dog from the crate.  Land at RDU, have maybe 20 minutes to deliver a puppy, check in, and go through TSA. Oh wait, I am “too late” because I was on the plane for the last four hours and didn’t check in at least an hour in advance and my seat was given away. I had no way of checking in when phone barely receives iMessage on the free WiFi. So I get a “seat request” and am told if I’m not fast enough that I’ll have to come back out and buy a new ticket. Strike two. After TSA, I sprint to my gate where I have seconds to spare. Luckily I have a seat left. During that flight is what sealed the deal. They offer flight fuel and meals. I wanted a specific one, I was given something else. Ok, I can deal. When the flight attendants come back to collect trash and recyclables, they never took mine. Keep in mind, this is the same staff that flew from SLC to RDU, now they’re serving in the return flight. They wouldn’t refill my water. Basically refusing service, and I’m suffering from nausea (all flights prior were rough), dehydration, and exhaustion. That’s not ok. They picked and chose who to serve. I had to leave my garbage in my seat upon landing because they wouldn’t take it. I was happy to get to SLC where Delta staff had better attitudes. The flight from SLC to PDX was better. I slept. I was woken up by the landing. I was happy to be off the plane. My recommendation for Delta is nonexistent. I wouldn’t recommend them to my worst enemy. Who ever was working that flight from SLC to RDU, and returning, you displayed very poor customer service. I wasn’t the only one to notice. They act as if they’re better than everyone.

Let start with my ticket: it's a round-trip ticket from Binghampton to New Orleans and versa. The flight from Binghamton --> New Orleans was 5:30 PM to 11:30 PM on Oct-5 Then, this was how it happened. My first flight was delayed for 1h30min, and of course, I missed my connecting flight. I have to stay in a hotel overnight in Detroit. I don't have much time with my family this trip, and now I have to spend 1 night in the middle of nowhere. I was really mad with them, they gave me a voucher $100, and at least I felt they care about my feeling. At that point, I can rate them 4 stars. The flight was delayed, but the reaction was good. The flight from New Orleans --> Binghamton was 5:30 PM to 11:30 PM on Oct-10. Again, the first flight was delayed for ""2 hours"". And again, I have to stay in Detroit 1 more night. I can't imagine how my trip 5 days with 4 days with my family turned into 6 days with 3 days at home. I contacted them about my issue, now the attitude was changed, they thought that they gave me $100 voucher and it's done. I deserve to have the delay one more time ""on the same trip"". They sent me to a hotel name Travelodge, it's a very very bad hotel. I arrived at the hotel at 11:30PM and hadn't had dinner yet. I was thirsty and need some water. Since I don't have cash with me so I ask the help desk at the hotel for some water. After I said I don't have cash, she told me to drink water in the bathroom, ""it's OK!"".  Now the wifi doesn't work, but I have to write this because I am really mad now. The lesson is: you may have a fault, but the way you fix it is more important. For the person who thought that $100 voucher is big, and it's ok to wait 2 nights for 2 delays on the same trip, I'm ashamed of you, you are so cheap!

Twenty minutes into the flight (after her and another stewardess sat back and gossiped) they began to serve passengers off of the beverage cart. After serving 3 quarters of the passengers, the attendant said ""Sorry, we are done."" I asked for a water and she said ""No, pilot's orders."" She later came by and asked if we had any trash to which I responded ""How could we, you didn't offer us anything?"" She asked if I was upset and I told her that I was because I just needed some water as I had traveled all day. She said to take it up with the pilot. At this point we still had half an hour until landing. Also, there was no turbulence. My Delta flier miles card is going bye-bye. You don't treat people like that."

Delta used to be one of the best airlines apart from Alaska, they used to take customer service seriously. I haven’t flown much in the last several years but due to work I am beginning to travel on a weekly basis. Delta has obviously gone downhill in the last several years. Not putting families together when flying, not able to assist with seat changes to accommodate families, and this entire process change. This will be my very last flight with this company. It’s sad how they’ve taken Northwest Airlines amazing customer service aspects and simply thrown them down the drain. What a shame."

I went to the ticket counter and asked about the earlier flight and was told I could get on it. They re-tagged my bags and I happily went through security and to my gate. When I arrived home, my bags didn't make it. I went to the Delta baggage office, and the clerk simply stated they were checked in late, they would be on the next flight and I could come back and get them. No apologies no nothing. I am most upset that the agent in Atlanta didn't say anything to me about it being late. Had I known I would have waited for my original flight. I am a Diamond member, and they can care less.

I was flying standby and my flight was originally supposed to be at 1154am. I was bumped off of 6 flights because of availability. It was time for the last flight out and I was very nervous. They called my name to board the plane and I was very relieved. I got settled on the plane and started reading my book. All of a sudden the flight attendant called my name and another gentleman’s name. Right before the plane was getting ready to take off they told both of us that we had to give up our seats. This was one of the most degrading experiences of my life! The supervisor made us get off the plane and give up our seats. The other person working for the airline told me she wasn’t supposed to do that because the people didn’t arrive until the plane was about to leave. This was the same supervisor that told me to board the plane. The supervisor showed no remorse whatsoever. I'd been at the airport since 930 am and now I’m going to miss work and not be able to get home to my pets! One of the delta employees that was working one of the flights I was bumped off earlier told me that the airport had an agreement with the local hotels for discounted rates for people that were displaced because of issues with flights. The supervisor told me that she was the only person I could speak with about my issue. She also didn’t mention the discounted hotel rates until I brought it up and the rates she told me were twice the amount of what the previous employee said. I understand that you aren’t guaranteed a seat flying standby but they shouldn’t treat people like they’re inferior. I also understand that people make mistakes but good companies do their best to rectify them. The supervisor I dealt with did the least she could to help me with this situation. I don’t recommend that anyone else uses Delta

My carry on bag was taken from my possession on board the flight as the overhead compartments were full. One of the hostesses came to our aid who promised to tag my bag and send it to the checked in baggage on the aircraft, of which I left total faith in the integrity of the staff. She apparently tagged my bag according to my seat number, and no receipt of this was given to me. When i disembarked the flight, while awaiting the baggage there is no sign of the bag. No one from Delta can give me any answers. It seems to be 'lost' or so im told. I have made numerous calls to the agents and i keep being told they are searching for the bag as there are many bags from Delta which are untagged.  I am currently miles away from home on a holiday which i saved up for a long time, the agents tell me to go ahead and purchase whatever needs to be replaced from the bag, then i am told it will take 4 weeks for the claim to be processed and there is no guarantee it will be fully reimbursed!"

I flew from SLC to LAX just fine, but when I flew from LAX to Orlando, I sat on the plane waiting for takeoff because there seemed to be issues with the plane. It ended up taking 2 hrs before we were able to take off, which is fine I understand things happen, and I’m glad it got taken care of (not to mention it pushed back all my plans and was very inconvenient.) Now, I’m heading back home and am making arrangements to get picked up, etc when I hear on the intercom that we can’t depart because there are more issues and it’s going to at least take an hour?

Then when we started boarding the gate attendant insisted that I tucked my 2inch x 4inch clutch inside my bag because it is the third bag. Then we proceed on to the plane and noticed that due to runway conflict we are now going to wait for another 40mins inside the airplane. Or at least that is the minimum estimate of wait wait time.

There were plenty of open seats at the time, and when we got on the plane we were seperated, different rows and different sides, among a bunch of passengers flying solo that insisted on staying put, for no damn reason. Got our trip off to a lousy start, for absolutely no reason, such a basic thing, they scammed us, and it was completely unnecessary. I will never, never fly this hack airline again, and I recommend that you dont either, they clearly have no concern for their customers comfort or satisfaction. Terrible 4.5 hr experience."

I was waiting at Washington Dulles airport not knowing what was going on until i called the customer service and found out that the particular flight has been rescheduled without been warned.

But, Delta did redeem themselves today, and they are sending me a check to cover the hotel room I paid for out of pocket that fateful night. Too bad they didn't cover the $50 taxi bill to the hotel, or the $50 in baggage fees, but at least they made good on the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised by the good training and demeanor of staff.

1610,2,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Greensboro,September 2018,,,,,1,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  Delta has to be the most inefficient and useless flight in hurricane situation. I was flying from Boston to Greensboro, NC for a job interview on Friday when the hurricane is supposed to hit the region. My employer canceled the interview, but since they did not cancel the flight, I was told that this is voluntary change that I am making. Additionally, I had to fly before September 20th, since the ""bulletin"" board mentioned that is the law. 2 flaws in these statements: A bulletin board cannot determine that my flight needs to be on a certain date because that is when my employer wants to interview. I would love to fly before September 20th, but I cannot do that- that is impossible from my employer's perspective.  When it is supposed to rain 20 inches and since you have not canceled the flight, does not mean that flight will not fly. Just because you dont cancel the flight does not mean that the hazard of the hurricane goes away. Extremely rude customer representatives who would argue with me about my own thought process, would not let me finish the sentence and would keep on going on and on about this supposed bulletin board that is their law. I have been a customer with Delta for over 10 years, but would not fly with them ever again."

1612,4,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Fort Myers,September 2018,4,5,4,5,1,,3,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  My family just traveled from Ft. Myers to Atlanta round trip on Delta. We purchased 5 economy tickets for 2 adults and 3 children. When we checked in for the first flight to ATL the counter personnel made a snide comment about our tickets being basic economy and how lucky we were to have seats in the same row. For this first leg we had 5 seats in row 40 with 1 other passenger between us. That was good and we had a fine flight. When I used the Delta mobile app to check in for our return flight to RSW, we were given 5 middle seats (737 seats b and e) throughout the plane. We didn't get 2 seats together. When travelling with children (9, 12, and 14) that is not disastrous, but still sucks. When I asked the Atlanta check in staff if there was anything they could do for us, that is when I really experienced how Delta feels about basic economy tickets. The check in person was very friendly and helpful until he saw what type of fare we had purchased. His demeanor and helpfulness completely changed as he informed us that our tickets were take any seat class. We went to customer service and received the same treatment, even after telling the rep the ages of our girls. At the gate we tried again, and this gentleman was even more discourteous. He told us he wouldn't even look to see if there were seats available for moving us. When we got on the plane (last - zone 4), several passengers saw our predicament and offered to move to accommodate us. We didn't ask them to. Nice to see there are good people flying on Delta even if the people running it are jerks. We fly often and usually on Frontier, Allegiant, Jet Blue, and Southwest Airlines without difficulty. No other airline has embarrassed me or belittled me for choosing to fly economy with them. Bottom line is, if you buy a published basic economy fare on Delta Airlines, be prepared to be admonished and treated like you don't deserve to be on their plane."
1613,3,,Couple Leisure,First Class,La Guardia to Houston,September 2018,3,1,1,,1,3,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I booked a first class trip for two on Delta Airlines using my Delta Sky-miles Platinum Card. We were flying from La Guardia to Houston. It’s about a four hour flight. For me, any flight over two hours I tend to fly first class. Unless, the ticket value is exceptional. Although I’ve held this card for sometime now, I’ve only flown first class twice on Delta. I generally use Delta to fly to Atlanta, which is approximately two hours. Anyway, the trip began with the rep at the gate informing us that we wouldn’t be able to sit together due to a broken seat. I was like that blows but whatever. Then I thought to ask the Delta Rep if maybe they could simply inquire with the passenger; who one of would be sat next to, if they didn’t mind switching to a different seat (still in first class but with no on occupying the seat next to it). I was told by the Delta Rep, that I should do it myself. Which, if that’s their policy, I get! He offered no other remedy. Maybe he could’ve said: hey, I realize it’s a bit of an inconvenience, separating you and if it’s important for you to be seated together; I could move you but you’d be losing first class service (which is much on Delta anyway). I just felt that there was no regard for professionalism. It matter of fact and deal with it attitude. The kicker was this, we boarded the plane and the “first class” Stewardess was no prize either. I will give this though, she did assist in getting us seated together. She then took drink and food orders. My order was taken first. Apparently, too many people ordered the chicken salad dish. She came back to me and here’s the dialogue: I can’t give you the chicken dish, you’ll have to have the pastrami sandwich. I said well I’ll pass, because I don’t eat pastrami. But how does that work anyway, you told me my choices and I selected like everyone else? She says we ran out of the chicken. I say, but you took my order first? She says well in looking at the medallion status, you fall to the bottom. What was so crazy about that is that I purchased both first class tickets and she brings my boyfriend the chicken salad! We both laughed like hell! Again, to her defense it could only be the Delta Airline to blame. No ideal how she decided he got to eat over me though. There is clearly no  training on tact or etiquette. And if I’m wrong in that statement; there is either no policy in place for common occurrences. The whole point of this review is to hopefully save anyone from wasting money on Delta first class. I’ve flown first class on American Airlines quite a few times also and have had zero complaints. Their planes even appear to be nicer. The meal thing wouldn't happen either as you select it 30 days to 24 hours before your flight. I’ll be getting rid of the Delta card. It serves no purpose."

I was seated twice on the plane and both times had to leave the plane because of some excuses. First they said the plane had some mechanical issues, then they said the pilot had just came from a 10 hour flight and was tired. Then they said we couldn’t leave because of bad weather, which was a complete cover up for everything else. I spent more than 24 hours at the airport and even had to sleep on the floor.

The first part of the trip was ok but unfortunately I can't say the same about the NY-Berlin portion. The flight was delayed in more than one hour and when I got to Berlin I found out my luggage had been lost. I didn't receive any support from Delta, instructions on what to do, if they were trying to track my luggage, anything. Everything I had was on my dispatched luggage, I had nothing but my passport, wallet and camera on me. When I complained about not getting any support from them, an employee gave me a toiletry kit with a small tooth brush and some shaving cream and sent me to the lost and found area of Tegel airport. After waiting in line for almost 2 hours, I was told there was nothing they could do and I should fill out a form online with my personal information and if they found my bag, they would contact me. When I tried to talk to Delta employees again, I discovered there were none at the airport anymore (it was 3 pm) and there was no one at the airport I could talk about my situation. On the following day, I returned to the airport to try to solve the situation with a Delta employee and I was told my luggage had arrived on the flight from New York that was landing at that time but they couldn't hand me my bag because it had to go through customs. After that, I kept receiving emails saying my luggage was still lost and couldn't be tracked and I should be patient. My luggage was only delivered on Wednesday of the following week. At any point I was not contacted by Delta airlines with instructions, received any support or voucher to pay for the extra expenses I had to have or even an apology note. Having spent half of my time in Berlin without my luggage seriously impacted my time there as I was always concerned that my luggage might be delivered while I was out of the house. I didn't stay at a hotel and the building didn't have a doorman and no one would be there to pick it up. I was worried about not having my things back at all as I kept getting emails saying they had no idea where my luggage was, was always uncomfortable from wearing clothes borrowed from friends and generally just stressed out by the lack of care toward me from Delta."

The storm was about to hit us so Delta moved up the departure time about 20 minutes so we could make it out safely. We made it out of there with no complications, barely even any turbulence.

Oh Delta! To begin, all my flights were on time. Stewardesses were pleasant. Except when one decided it was ok to tell me that I’d be much prettier if I didn’t have on my beanie hat. But I degress. My sole complaint is about every single solitary employee I came in contact with whether at ticketing or the gate. All of them were unwelcoming, stood with a sour look on their face, had a lack of personality and enthusiasm for their jobs, didn’t make customers feel appreciated and made me feel like I was bothering them if I asked them a question. Whew! From someone who is in the hospitality industry and understands the importance of customer service, Delta receives a big fat F! The initial contact with a company is everything and if I was a person of authority within this organization, I’d perform a complete retraining on all front desk staff.

Delta was too incompetent to figure out the new reservation, even after we gave them the new confirmation number and showed them the email we received from Delta conforming our new flight - once Delta figured out what was going on (they took too long) and then said the flight just closed and we were no longer allowed to check in. Now we had no flight home and had to start all over again. When asked to speak with a Delta supervisor, we were told that one was not available and because the guy was only a trainee he couldn’t help us. Thanks to AA  they were able to help find us another flight. I will never chose Delta for a flight option ever. Their customer service is one of the worst I’ve seen!"

The airline service is okay generally, but not for a team out for a robotics competition: we were in Houston for a robotics competition and checked our robot before the flight.

Delta mobile app so useful and efficient with the possibility to truck your luggage also. Wi-fi was working on all flights perfectly and for free. "

Called customer service to change my seats, because I was traveling with my 3 1/2 year old. I said I will pay whatever the price is for ""comfort"" seats, they said I don't even qualify to pick those seats. The ""roomy"" seats were by the exits and I can't sit there with a kid. Bottom line I was stuck by the bathrooms on a 5 hour flight with my son. We fly frequently and this was the First and last time we will fly with Delta. A I would rather pay way more than fly with Delta. Worst I've ever flown! "

I didn't realize my passport was expired until I was in the airport to check in, while my families' are still active, they left without me. I was in a great disappointment since we are traveling to Canada I couldn't leave without a passport. One of the ground crews showed her empathy and kindly lead me to the special help crews. They talked and came up with a plan, since it was early in the morning and we are close to Chicago (~8am), they tried to help me get to Chicago Passport Agency (closed at 3pm) and have my passport renewed on the same day. So that they booked me a ticket to Chicago and rebooked my trips for the next early morning leaving from Chicago all for free! Since I needed two 2""x 2"" pictures and form DS 82 before I go to the CPA, staff helped me to find a nearest place where I could get those documents, and she even walked me down to the ground transportation. It was a long day and lots of running, but I was so lucky everything worked so smoothly, I was at Calgary just about 12 hours later than our original arrival time. My trip wouldn't happen without the help of these staff. Delta has super sweet staff and fare price. "

No representatives to speak with only told the flight left and to go to a different gate when at gate and told to go to baggage claim because desk was closing. Flight could have waited less than 5 min for the late delta flight to get off as next flight was one gate down. Oh and we couldn't get off flight because a truck was blocking gate. No excuse for this any other business would be bankrupt.
1634,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York City to Sacramento via Atlanta,August 2018,3,2,3,4,1,4,1,0,Not Verified ,"  My recent flight from JFK New York to Sacramento via Atlanta was 24 hours from hell. Despite my efforts in trying to remain optimistic, experiencing disappointment after disappointment, I had to choice but to just be upset. I flew out of JFK on a rainy day, therefore all of the Delta flights were delayed. I found it curious that the online airline that experienced delayed take-offs was Delta that day, but what can you do? The delay would make me miss my second flight I need to get to my final destination. When I spoke to a Delta employee about re-navigating my flight, I was given very half-invested attention. From making jokes constantly with her fellow employee, to forgetting what she was searching for, she ended up booking me on my original flight in hopes we would make up time in the air. I just went with it, trusting a professional opinion over my own. Of course the flight was delayed even more and I missed my flight and the second option she put me on standby for. Delta accommodated me with a hotel and meal voucher. I the next available flight from Atlanta to Sacramento the next morning. Not anything you can do at this point. As inconvenient as this was, this is not the part of my Delta experience that really put me off. After finally arriving to Sacramento, I only an item that was at the top of one of my bags was missing and my other bag was missing altogether. When I finally received my second bag at home that night via their delivery service, the wheel was completely broken off and the side of my baggage had a big hole in it. Can't recommend this airline after receiving my belongings in such a state. Basically I received poor customer service, 12 hours added to my travel and over $300 worth of damage/lost items."

Worst flight experience I have ever had. I have flown a lot for work and vacation. Delta Airlines cancelled my flight due to “weather conditions”, but the nothing supported that reason. Delta failed to plan for contingencies and left several individuals and families stranded at JFK without any accommodations or productive solutions for their customers. The staff were rude and displayed no compassion to the travelers. Bottom line, do not fly Delta Airlines."

I booked a trip to Vegas for a wedding. The flight was delayed to the point I was late for the wedding. There was absolutely no customer service. Every employee I talked to trying to get a different flight just blew me off. One actually told me I should have booked with another airline because all the Delta flights are late. She was correct. Every single flight has been delayed. Its cost me a total of over 8 hours of layover time. What a joke. Awful customer service and nothing but late flights. I would recommend any other company besides Delta.

There were mild showers for 30 mins or so, but most other airlines were operating, even Delta had another flight 4 hrs later on the same day to same destination. They could have delayed the flight by 2-3 hrs, but they cancelled it and booked a flight for 14th morning. It will throw off all my subsequent plans (extended hotel stay in New York, plans in BUF and flight booked from BUF back to NYC). I tried booking some other airlines within 2-3 hrs, the prices of which were $600-700 for each ticket. It was a very uncomfortable and stressful experience."

The checked bag will be charged for 25USD for the first bag when checked in. My bag was 55 lbs which is a bit exceed the allowance. I asked the staff to repack my bag, removing something out and re-scale the weight. She blamed me and talked many words. She wanted me to pay the heavy-bag charge just because to complete everything quickly. Then I gave up and let her charge the fee. She completed printing the tag and receipt and said ""a hundred dollars"". I have just known the fee at that moment. She never informed the fee before. 100USD is about 80% of my ticket price. My friends checked-in at the counter beside. Staff advised them to re-pack. She was very polite and helpful. Poor me, wrong counter, changed the experience. On cabin experience, everything went very well. Thai cabin crew on board was very very nice. She was very helpful, respectful and service-minded. All other crews were also nice. Overall experience over the Delta domestic short flight was good except only one bad ground staff at the check-in counter."

In fact, we never actually ended up flying and did not make it to our destination. We were originally booked to fly to NYC on August 4th and back on August 5th for a weekend trip, and that flight was delayed for 2 hours and then cancelled after a very short time, and I'm about 99% sure this was due to a mechanical issue. We rebooked for the next weekend on the same flights (August 11th-August 12th), and the gate agent was willing to upgrade us to first class. Sounds great, right? I guess it would've if that had actually worked out. That flight was delayed for 3 hours and then cancelled AGAIN. Now, this time, it was due to weather, which they can't control; however, this is the first time I've been cancelled due to weather. In the past, I've been delayed for a long time, but not cancelled. We rebooked on another flight, this was 3 hours later, and it gets delayed due to weather/late inbound flight, and once it finally makes it to the gate, we get ready to board, and then the gate agent announces that the flight was cancelled again literally just as the plane is about to board. Some airlines like to keep delaying the flight and are really hesitant to cancel, where as Delta just decides to give up and cancel the flights. We went back to the counter and asked to rebook and there was one agent there who was literally the opposite of helpful, and he kept asking us to wait a minute, and then stand back, and to give priority to the people on the Paris flight, and my dad had to call his attention by saying, ""Don't worry about us. We're just customers going to go to New York,"" and the one woman that was standing next to him gave another sarcastic remark, and then they walked away. We waited an hour and a half on the phone to ask if we could be reimbursed. They were willing to give us our money back. I've flown Delta many times without incident, but I have to say I was quite disappointed this time. I'm not saying I won't fly them again because I will, but this was an experience that really let me down.  They are usually good to us, but this was an experience that I won't soon forget. My ratings for Value for money and Ground service are based on this trip. My ratings for Seat comfort and Cabin Staff service can't apply for this trip because we never actually made it into the air or even on the plane, so they are based on past experiences with Delta."

I checked in online and printed my boarding pass, but it took 35 minutes in a huge long line simply to drop off my bag in Austin. After arriving in Seattle, it took one full hour after the flight reached the gate before I got my bag!! From what the staff told me, the bags were unloaded from the airplane but no one was there to deliver them to the baggage claim area. We were all standing around waiting for our bags and it took a very long time for the staff to figure out what happened. Finally I got my bag and was given a ticket for some bonus miles, but the agent did not tell me that I only had 3 days to claim them. I waited until I returned home a week later, and by then it was too late to get the miles. The flight was expensive and uncomfortable The 6:40 am departure time was too early. And wasting over 1.5 hours of my time on dropping off and collecting my suitcase was inexcusable. Overall a terrible experience with Delta and I will avoid flying with them in future."

I had no other options to fly out of the same airport, so I had to switch to another airport almost an hour away. My return flight home was returning to the airport I had originally booked with and if I wanted to change that flight it would cost me more money since that flight was not cancelled. A whole bunch of phone calls and issues 3 hours later I had my new flight, but needed to now book a car to drive me since my car could be in Boston MA when I was flying back to Manchester NH. $150 later I had the ride, but the hassle of all this was not fun. I feel as though cancellation should happen much sooner and if one flight is cancelled, you should be able to change the return flight at no extra cost. I will never fly this airline again."

No explanation of where our bags were. Filed our missing bags report with KLM baggage office. Made several phone calls every day trying to track down our missing luggage. Call after call, lie after lie. Total disregard and lack of follow through. After day 6 I really started to panic when my husband received an email from Delta saying that our bags were delivered to us and the file was closed. No joke. I started calling like a maniac at this point. KLM and Delta - all different stories. Our bags showed up on day 11 of our 13-day cruise. Our trip was ruined. I have never been so furious, frustrated, and frantic in my life. Shame on you, Delta. Losing a customers bag for so many days and not taking responsibility for it is inexcusable."

The last flight was delayed totally 12 hours including 1 hour in plane. The nightmare was, they extended the delay every hour and then every 20 minutes and they changed the gate for almost every time. We had to stay in the terminal, moved every time they extended the delay and changed gate. Our kids could not take a rest after 21 hours flying from Asia. They slept while sitting on the ground, in the crowd, in front of the gate to wait. I talked to Delta reps, they said ""sorry"" and turned their back. I did not see that they cared or felt sorry. It is the word they use to avoid troubles. It was not only our flight. Delta's terminal was a mess with many flights canceled, delayed, changed gate. We used to have problems with Delta. If there was another choice, we did not travel with Delta. Value for money - No. Cost to fly with Delta is not low. Ground service - Delta attendants are robots. They do not care. Seat comfort - small, narrow. Cabin staff service - The only thing they can do is to bring you water. Conclusion: very high price for very low cost flight."

The entire experience was so terrible that it still gives me nightmares. The itinary from Seattle to Paris was uneventful. The horror started when I landed in Paris for the connection to delhi. The flight was cancelled due to technical issues, and Delta rebooked me via Air France to Munich, and then via Lufthansa from Munich to Delhi. Nobody however thought of these 3 things when rebooking me. France needs a schengen transit visa when changing the airports. I of course did not have that. I was denied boarding to Munich due to this. I would need new boarding passes from Air France and Lufthansa. Since this was a rebooking, the PNR changed. Delta did not provide me with that, and I had to run back & forth between counters in CDG airport to find Air France counters to give me the boarding pass. There was an available flight from Paris to Mumbai, but Delta did not book me on that. I eventually reached via CDG-DXB-DEL. The DXB-DEL was via Emirates, which was a pleasure. The whole ordeal added 12 hours to my travel time. Delta did not agree to any refund / compensation (they shook off any responsibility for this). "

The flight was delayed for more than 4.5 hours ( due to some cooling system issue with the aircraft ). This with an airline , which is supposedly in top 3 of US airlines. The customer service is a joke, only 1 person trying to answer questions of an entire flight. People missing their connections, and the response is a shoulder shrug. I also observed the ground staff to be rude, and unhelpful to elderly passengers. Delta does not care that when we reach to our destination at 1 am in the night, the passengers have to pay surcharge for Uber, and wont obviously compensate for it. Any snacks, and hot meals wont compensate for the terrible handling of the entire situation."

There were one dinner after taking-off, one breakfast during flight, and one lunch before landing. These dishes were good and the snack was also great. I was impressive by the internet connection during the flight, even over the Pacific. That was a wonderful experience since I can keep connecting with my family, my friends, and others via the internet. For entertainment, there were many latest films and videos, especially I liked the documentary videos. Summary, even though I just flew in economy class, this was a wonderful experience."

How in the world does an airline not have a crew to fly a plane scheduled months in advance? Why is there no back up in place. Customer service is a joke, spoke to a supervisor who was condescending and absolutely useless, not at all sympathetic or customer service oriented.

The same thing happened on the return flight. I thought it was a very personal touch and made him feel special. Both flights were pleasant, the aircraft clean and we even arrived a little early on both flights. I would advise anyone to fly Delta as the go the extra mile.

First of all this flight was delayed at least 4 times which caused our connection to get totally messed up many times. Because it left so late in the evening, we ate before boarding. Then within 1 hour of boarding they served dinner at 1am, which we had already eaten dinner, so we skipped it. Then we only got food again breakfast just before landing at LAX. Then it took over an hour to get through customs and then another 2 hours on top of that to get our luggage. Then we had to totally check back into the airport because we missed our flight and they made us leave. So now it's almost 8:40 and back through security, baggage and about to board connection and our tickets were invalidated and my wife's TSA wasn't applied to her ticket or app so the added pain there and landed in PHX after 11pm and all is closed in the Delta terminal. So didn't get any real food again until we left the airport after midnight which options are very limited. So that's from 9pm Tokyo time (our 5am) till 11pm to get any real food beside a breakfast snack. Worst experience I've ever had on Delta and has ruined us for all future air travel on Delta!"

We get on the flight in JFK and hit bad weather. Aviation rules say they let us off after 3 hours of sitting on the tarmac. It took 4 hours. There were a lot of us traveling and my brothers San Diego flight took off within minutes of them unloading our plane. The captain said the crew on our plane would time out in the air to Las Vegas so they just cancelled our flight. My in laws on a flight to Phoenix were also brought back to the terminal because their captain timed out. The best delta could do was get us home by midnight the next night via a ton of transfers but couldn’t leave jfk until 2 the next afternoon as all flights were sold out. Then I find a San Diego flight that was supposed to leave at 7:25 but it’s delayed until 12:40 so we get that flight because it’s close enough. The soonest they can get us out of San Diego is 5 pm. I’m on the phone with delta and the lady talks to me for over 20 minutes. Most of the time on hold. I walked to the gate and asked the ticket agent about getting on the flight he gets us passes before this lady can get me off hold. Not sure what she could have possibly been doing. I decided to purchase tickets on southwest because now I’m getting home on Saturday and I leave again on Tuesday. We are returning from a 3 week trip and just want to be home. I’m also flying with children. We finally get on the San Diego flight but there’s no pilot so we don’t leave until 1:40 am. But the icing on the cake is that we are given comfort plus seats and I ask for blankets and pillows when we sit down. The flight attendant says she will check when she gets a second—she was a little frantic over whether a pilot was actually coming. No one helps me so I try to sleep. Get up to use the bathroom and see the entire coach class with blankets and pillows. When I ask again, they are all out. The in laws were loaded on a plane to Atlanta, driven out to the taxi way and then brought back to the gate because the pilot timed out. Why even put the people on the plane?? They can cry weather all they want but the flight I got on had their entire crew time out so they pulled another crew and put them on this flight so we could take off. It’s interesting how forth coming these people are with their information. This crew could have been given to the vegas flight. I can’t see how it’s cost effective to strand 100’s of people. I’m paying and extra $800 to get home because delta can’t get their act together. And then I can’t get a blanket? "

Delta delayed my fight and denied me a seat on an earlier flight with an available empty seat. I was at the gate 45 minutes before takeoff, had my ID out, and boarding pass in hand. When they asked if I had checked a bag, I foolishly answered “yes.” The supervisor used that as the reason for denying me a seat, citing it would be a “security” issue. So I guess every time we fly on a Delta flight with a bag belonging to someone who missed her connection, we are risking our security?? Does it take Delta over 45 minutes to locate and transfer a checked bag?? Is an ontime departure of a plane with empty seats more important than customer service? I wonder how Southwest and Jet Blue handle this scenario — based on customer reviews, I am most certain it is not like Delta does!"

I purchased two round trip tickets to have my kids come visit me. I paid the fee to have them accompanied by a Delta employee. At the time I purchased the tickets I gave both parents information. The flight was changed at the last minute and was not even notified. When I took my kids the the airport for the return flight they didn't have My Ex's info so I had to give it to them again. When my kids arrived they didn't let her through security because they said I didn't pay the fee to have them accompanied by Delta employee. Which I did. I cost me an extra $300. So they were going to have to walk by themselves down to baggage claim. Something they have never done before. Complete lack of organization. When I got to the ticketing counter the ticketing agent didn't even know how to activate the tracker arm bracelets. Delta is incompetent.

After returning from a family fishing trip that had the first leg canceled. On the return we flew out of Duluth they charged me $200 or $2/pound for fish. My brother who was traveling on United Flight 5167 the same day paid nothing for the same amount of fish in his cooler. They told me they would respond to my complaint 45 days later. They called me on the 25 day and told me they did not know where the excessive freight charges were posted on there web site and the would not reduce my charges to even be competitive with United Airlines. I guess I will fly United next time.

Mobile to Atlanta flight one hour behind with a stewardess that shouted rudely over the mic for a passenger to sit down, not use the restroom. We had been sitting in the plane for over 45 minutes.

Been thru this many times with Delta and will drive to another departure city so I don’t spend my money with this crew. Terrible!"
1666,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Dayton via Atlanta,July 2018,4,1,4,4,2,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  We have had the worst experience flying with delta. We got off of our cruise ship at 9am on 7/20/18 and were required to take the shuttle to the airport where I waited with my mother, my 14 year old son and his 14 year old friend. After waiting all day for our 6:40pm flight we were informed it was delayed over four hours and we would miss our layover flight from Atlanta to Dayton because of it. So they gave us standby tickets for an earlier flight (from Orlando to Atlanta) that was already overbooked; when I asked about getting a hotel room at the Orlando airport for the night and just traveling in the morning I was told they wouldn’t cover any of the costs and that we needed to take our original flight to Atlanta if we couldn’t get on any earlier flights and for the second time we were put on standby for yet another overbooked flight (they offered $600 to people to give up seats) because they were already overbooked. They went ahead and changed our missed flight from Atlanta to Dayton to the following morning at 8:10am so we were supposed to be all set for when we finally arrived in Atlanta. Finally we boarded our very delayed flight to Atlanta after being at the airport for over 13 hours when we arrived in Atlanta at 1am there was no one to help us find a hotel or somewhere to sleep so I went to the help phone to ask them. The delta help lady on the phone informed me we weren’t even secheduled for any flights from Atlanta to Dayton!!!!! She went ahead and set the flight up for us (she was the only helpful person; she also informed me that the closets place to stay was not within walking distance) so we had to nap in chairs at Atlanta airport until our 8:10am flight. Then our 8:10 flight got delayed another two and a half hours so here we sit we have been at the airport for over 24 hours with absolutely no accommodations (besides one nice worker NOT with Delta that brought us blankets and snacks at 2am because everything was closed and she was off of work for the night). This mornings flight is said to be delayed due to weather however when I tracked the plane it is still at its last destination where the weather is clear....we do have rain in Atlanta however all the other planes are arriving and departing just fine! Delta is a joke and I will discourage everyone I know from using this horrible airline!"
1667,2,,Business,Economy Class,Detroit to Tampa,July 2018,4,4,3,4,1,3,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Detroit to Tampa. Recently I decided to start using Delta Airlines. It was a fairly last minute trip so I scheduled a flight from Detroit to Tampa and paid around $450. I scheduled the 8:20 PM because I didn't know what time I would be done with work. It turned out my assignment ended early so I got to the airport at 1PM to try to get on a 3:30PM flight. At first I was informed there would be a $75 fee to change to the earlier flight which was fine with me and well worth it. Then after looking up my fare the Delta employee told me that I could not change the flight because I had an economy fare. The only option was to buy a new ticket for close to $500 on the 3:30 flight. I asked if I could go standby they said no. I asked if there was anything I could do to get on the earlier flight short of paying another full fare. They said ""sorry but you purchasd the cheap fare and Delta tries to make as much as they can."" So the 3:30 flight was delayed until 4:45. I hung around hoping I could get on the flight. I tried again and Delta said that if the 8:20 is delayed then they would allow me to get on the earlier flight. I asked them to check and they said it was not delayed - sorry. Once everyone boarded the earlier flight I tried again and they said they could not put me on the flight even though there was plenty of extra seats. The later flight is not delayed and that is the only way they would allow it. The flight left. Not 10 minutes goes by and I get an email saying the 8:20 is delayed. Delta Airlines does not care about accommodating its passengers. They could have put me on that earlier flight and made an extra $75 but they chose to be greedy and make me sit in the airport for another 4 hours. My flight has been delayed to 8:45 and I am betting it will be later than that. Fly Southwest - they are the best when it comes to making changes to your flight. They are very accommodating easy to deal with and generally care about their passengers. I will not fly Delta again."

On my recent trip from Peoria, IL to Bozeman, MT, along with my two adult daughters and a niece, the young man pushing my wheelchair at the Minneapolis airport was very helpful in getting us to the departure gate on time. On our return trip, the plane was very late leaving Bozeman for Minneapolis. We only had 10 minutes from deplaning time to our departure to Peoria. That young man, pushing my wheelchair, was also very helpful. When we exited the tram from Section D to Section A, we heard our names called for the flight. We were at A 1 and going to A 13. My 53 year old daughter said, should I run and the young man said Yes. She started running and then my 61 year old daughter started running and passed her sister. They were waiting for our group when she arrived at the departure gate because they could see the ""girls"" running toward them. I'm sorry I did not get the names of those two young men who were so helpful to get us from one plane to another. Also thankful that the gate agent saw the girls running toward then and held the plane. Also wish I had a video of the event."

The check in process in Accra delayed for about 3 hours due to a system failure so essentially our baggage didn't make it to Boston. Due to the system failure, Delta couldn't pull up my records which it later turned out, they had wrongfully assigned my baggage to another person. Basically it took Delta 3 weeks to find and deliver my bags. To add insult to injury, Delta decided to compensate me with $100, and even that, it's a voucher I have to use towards my next ticket purchase with Delta. Such an appalling gesture from Delta after this grueling ordeal; from terrible experience in their sister Air France flight to wasting my time for 3 weeks. I will not fly Delta again."

I bought my ticket asked for a window seat, checked in about 24 hours prior to departure, got to the airport three hours early and guess what, got a middle seat for a 14 hour trip on a full plane. Argued my point with the counter clerk and all I got was you can fly standby next flight. Worst airline ever! "

Her mom booked through an agency. We were never made aware of a $150 unaccompanied minor fee. Her flight was cancelled due to poor weather. I get that. It happens but the customer service that followed is unacceptable. Gate agent told my 16 year old daughter that since the fee was not paid there was nothing she could do. My wife had to speak to gate agent on speaker phone to even get her to do basic customer service. The lack of compassion this gate agent showed is appalling. Regardless of any additional fees paid or not the safety of a minor should have been Delta Airlines main priority. Leaving a minor stranded without rectifying the issue is unacceptable. It should not have taken a call from an adult to fix. She knows her job she chose to be lazy and do the bare minimum or actually even less than that. With all the bad press Delta has been receiving you would think that retraining your agents would be a priority. Shame on you Delta Airlines for leaving a 16 year old kid crying hysterically and doing nothing to solve the problem. Your lack of compassion and human decency is noted.

After being on hold for over an hour with Air France, they finally changed me to a different flight that actually got me to my destination earlier than before, which I thought was impressive. With my return flight, I got a email at 3am that my flight for that evening was canceled again! I called once again, and surprisingly, the wait time wasn’t nearly as long as the the one before. My flight was moved to Lufthansa. On arrival to the airport  I could not even check my bags in for the flight. I’ve checked in online, got my seat and everything else - my seat was given to another person. I decided to have nothing to do with both Delta and Air France and requested for my money back.

Our Delta experiences have always been lackluster but these past 2 trips have been horrible. We consider ourselves to be consistent flyers of Delta (4 flights a year) and seem to be considered part of the “lower class” in their terms. Being forced to fly in zone 4 everytime has began to reveal the garbage service of Delta. Using zone 4 we NEVER get to bring out bags on board and always have them checked in. Zone 4 also NEVER gets to choose where we sit and get our entire family split and stick in the middle seat all through the plane. Our trip from Washington DC to Detroit was a short bearable trip as it was an hour but this past trip was horrible as having my children with randoms spread across the plane is a horrible way to treat a family. Upon calling to fix our seating the situation got worse, the computer system told us they would call us back in 3 hours . This is ridiculous customer service. They finally called back and told us we could switch with other passengers but NO ONE wants to switch seats to sit in the middle and we were stuck in our horrible seats. This is how Delta treats it’s frequent flyers. Don’t bother trying to be loyal to them. They will never be loyal back to you!"

The seating in economy class was in a 2-4-2 configuration and I had an aisle seat in the two seat block. The leg space was sufficient. A personal IFE provided opportunities to view movies and tv shows, listen to music, and track the flight. Controls were easy to use. Earphones were provided. Selection was on the small side but was sufficient. A menu flier was provided - I chose a vegetarian pasta dish, it came with the usual accompaniments of salad, bread, and dessert. Beer and wine were complimentary. A light morning pre-arrival snack was served. The flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Luggage space overhead was ample. A sleep mask, pillow, and blanket came with the seat. The aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth. At check in at JFK's Delta terminal 4, I printed out my boarding pass from a machine and did not have to interact with an agent at a desk. The organization of boarding was more or less smooth with gate agents making announcements and screens displaying boarding status. There was no anxiety or stress at the gate. Nothing to complain about. Delta did its job - taking a customer to his destination on time and in comfort. I have been flying them more often now and find that they are offering a quality product."

1679,1,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Vancouver,July 2018,1,1,1,,2,1,1,0,Not Verified ," San Diego to Vancouver. Horrible experience. The flight had a maintenance issue, which in itself is completely understandable and that I was ok with. Our flight was from San Diego @ 5:25 pm with a layover in LA for 1.5 hours to Vancouver. We were told the flight had been delayed for 10 mins. Come back the flight is delayed for another 10 mins. Come back again and the lady said if it is anywhere past 6:20 we have to come to the front to change our flights as we would miss our connecting. Again totally fine, I am in a line up with one person in front of me awaiting the new update (currently states 6:20 departure) - flights delayed until 8:45pm - again totally fine. Then things start going south. The line was told if we wanted faster service to take a red card and call the number to change flights so I take a card and step out of line as I had to meet my boyfriend to let him know what was happening. I call the airline and there isn't a single flight that night until the next day. Ok that sucks but fine... we both have to book off work the next day now and so I asked politely if there was anything that they could do to make the situation better (aka seat upgrade). Nope notta. Fine. Well can I continue booking my hotel then as I would hope you cover that. Sorry mam, but you have to go to the ladies at the gate to book a room - so now I have to go back to the same line I was encouraged to step out, again 1 person in front of me before. 1 and 1/2 hours later (4 hours since arriving at the airport) finally get to the front- again. I explain to the same lady who told me to step out of the line what happened and again politely asked for anything to make the situation better - again nothing. Standard hotel room and food vouchers which are only good at the airport  which we cant use for the meal we already ate while waiting for the delays. Then on our first flight they didn't seat us together and on the second connecting flight (2.5 hours) there were no TV's . This was pretty ridiculous there was zero customer service in handling the situation. We had to take another vacation day which we couldn't even take advantage of because anything worth going to in San Diego takes a full day. At the end of all of it they couldn't at least put us in Premium economy or give us credit we could use for something outside of spending more time at the airport or upgrade our room. I strongly suggest not taking this airline. Cancellations don't happen often but I would rather be stuck with an airline that cares about their customer experience rather than one which is just trying to fill seats. (San Diego restaurants however happily covered each of us for drinks so props to those guys for knowing something about customer service.)"

On our return flight their was no air and was super hot. We are still currently in the airport now waiting for a delayed flight.

This most recent trip has had two flight delays, one that caused us to have to take a shuttle to another airport to get a different flight so we wouldn’t miss our connection and the other over 2 hours delayed. They ran out of meals on our 10 hour flight from Amsterdam to Seattle, so my family was left with the snacks that we left over. They tagged our luggage improperly, but luckily I was paying attention and caught the mistake before they sent all of our bags. They did send one down the belt with the wrong tag on it and couldn’t figure out which bag it was, but we managed to get that fixed just in time to run to our plane, even though we arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before our flight was scheduled to depart. I’ve traveled all over the world, and I’m sad to say that airlines from third world countries seem to operate more professionally and efficiently than delta. I tried to give them this one last chance, but I think I’ll just avoid them from now on."

I was having an anxiety attack and went to use the restroom as soon as the plane was in the gate, but I was unaware that the seatbelt sign was still on. If anyone has ever had an anxiety attack, you feel detached from your surroundings and it can be easy to make a mistake like getting up to go to the restroom 3 minutes prior to receiving permission. When I got to the restroom, one flight attendant told me to sit down, and as soon as she said that an announcement came on so I paused to listen. While I was trying to listen, both flight attendants began yelling at me to sit down so I could not hear the announcement and I was already shaking from my anxiety attack. I went to sit down, the seatbelt sign went off, and I walked back to the restroom. I was so nervous that the flight attendants would yell at me again that I waited for them to tell me it was okay to use the restroom. One of the flight attendants looked at me, angrily reached in front of me and yelled ""PUSH"" to show me how to open the door as if I were completely incompetent. I didn't say anything and went to the restroom, but while I was in there I could hear the two flight attendants talking about me. Overall, this experience was terrible, and the lack of humanity in Delta airplanes shocks me."

Finally got on that plane, sat on tarmac for 2 hours, and returned to gate for mechanical problems after hearing horrible noise on replacement plane. So two planes in one day with mechanical problems. Then they had to get another crew. So if two out of two planes have mechanical problems, this is airline to avoid at all cost.

All the staff were caring and considerate. Delta has recently upgraded their A319 aircraft, there are larger overhead bins so the plane holds more carry ons. The plane also features Inflight entertainment screens. Delta’s new selection of snacks are great. "

1700,10,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Aruba,May 2018,5,5,,,5,,5,1,Not Verified ,"  Flew to Aruba last month with no issues. Was scheduled to fly to Nebraska today (June 2018) from Ford Airport in Grand Rapids, MI, with a connecting flight in Minneapolis. Wanted to give credit and thanks to the great Customer Service Representative who helped us. Our flight to Minneapolis was very delayed, which meant we were going to miss our connecting flight in Minneapolis going to Omaha. This staff member checked every other possible flight options and everything was booked. She graciously checked on refunding our flight money, which was granted. We are ever so thankful in her turning a bad situation into a more positive one. We drove to Omaha, but have always had great service through Delta Airlines, and won't hesitate to keep flying through them!!"

Flight got delayed to 1:15am. Then flight got delayed to 2:20. Flight got delayed again until 3:20. Told us that it’s not guaranteed. At this point we are the only people in the airport here with the night workers and construction workers. You have people sleep on the floors and sleep anywhere they can. This is very inconvenient! We had a room booked and we are still currently stuck at the airport uncomfortable! I will never book with Delta again! Very unprofessional. So upset that we have been in the airport for five hours already!
1703,2,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,New York to Barcelona ,June 2018,2,4,2,5,1,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  I wanted to alert fellow fliers that Delta Comfort Plus is really a scam, at least on this flight from New York to Barcelona. This is not premium economy at all. All it is seats with 3 inches more pitch. You get the same long boarding line as economy, same cabin, same seats, same meals, everything the same except a little more legroom. On top of that, a boarding system that was laughable and bad food (I mean inedible). This, for an extra $1000 per person, was insane. On the other hand, flight crew on both flights were excellent, as was the selection of movies on the in flight entertainment system. Save money and fly economy."
1704,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Haneda via Minneapolis,May 2018,1,1,1,,1,,1,0,Not Verified ,"  This flight was delayed by one hour or so, which made me miss subsequent flights Delta 0121 (MSP to HND) and China Eastern 0540 (HND to PVG). This delay caused me to change my subsequent flight to next day which caused a penalty of $1,187.90 that I had to pay to China Eastern. Also, when Delta booked me for the next day flight, they told me that my single piece of luggage will be in the same flight as me and that I should not be worried about it. Next day I came early to the airport and wanted to double check that my luggage is on-boarded with me in the same flight, to my surprise, I figured out that my piece of luggage was actually sent to Chicago and no one can explain why? I spent an hour with luggage service, at the end they told me that we are forwarding it to Shanghai and that it will be in Shanghai 8 hours before me, so, I was OK to just go to luggage service to pick it up once there. When I reached Shanghai, the luggage service could not even track it, China Eastern had no clue where it is. Next day I spend couple hours on the phone to try to figure out when can I receive my luggage but didnt get anything. I called then Delta luggage service, they told me that my luggage is still in Chicago and it is planned to go to HND next day then to PVG. After calling 2 to 3 times a day, finally I received my luggage 4 days since my original flight. I was on a business trip and my stop at Shanghai was primary for meetings scheduled for Saturday April 28th, due to delay, I missed these meeting and my stop at Shanghai become worthless. I couldnt make up for these meetings since Monday and Tuesday was a Holiday in China and I had to continue my trip to my next stop in Wuhan. The damage caused by this delayed flight and luggage is difficult to quantify beside the cash penalty that I paid ($1,187.90). I would like per this complaint to explain all the negative impact I went through due to a delay of a Delta flight.Resolution: Sugar coated email with 7500 bonus point. Total disrespect to customer."

Our flight was delayed multiple times making a 3 hour delay and would result in missing our connecting flight into Seattle to make it to Kauai. There were no later flights this same day to Kauai, so we were scheduled for the next morning to fly from Medford to Seattle (now we’ve missed our first night of vacation). After asking the airline how often this happens, she responded maybe 1/15 planes are delayed and was unlikely it would happen again. Then our next morning flight scheduled for 5.45am and was for the second time, delayed 3 hours to 8.30am and we were scheduled to miss our connecting flight in Seattle once again! Although Delta re-imbursed tickets and we will still make it to Kauai this evening through yet a third scheduling conflict - it has put us behind 24 hours into our trip. Needless to say I will not be planning on flying Delta Air Lines for quite some time- at least out of Medford. Completely ridiculous."

I have a receipt and many emails saying I will be compensated USD 300 - I have still after three months not seen the money. I get emails from Delta all the time saying how sorry they are and that the amount will be put into my account but it never happens. All emails they send cannot be replied to. There is only one Norwegian phone number provided that transfers me to KLM Holland. They transfer me on to the USA where I am put on hold for long times. I hanged up once after 34 minutes. I have called and spoken to a number of people I have been transferred to but never end up with the right person. They all tell me to go to [email protected]. I have done that several times but only end up with emails saying how sorry the are and that the email cannot be replied to. I has been a nightmare and no one takes responsibility. But they are extremely good at saying how sorry they are and send email to me time after time that the money will be transferred to me!

The flight boarded and left on time. It arrived 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Plenty of food and beverages during the flight. Friendly, capable, but very ""experienced"" flight attendants. The plane is old, this one was over 21 years old, but well maintained. Seat pitch in economy is tight. The IFE content is excellent, although the system had to be rebooted after take off, which took 30 minutes. Recommended. The ground handling at both Amsterdam, with the ridiculous questioning due to US regulation, and the line at Orlando for US immigration make DL to loose some stars, but can't be entirely attributed to the airline."

That is how far out we booked our travel plans. For the first time we decided to try first class. Now, the flight out was much better than the return which is what I am rating here. Note above my indication of how far out we booked. So, we checked in online and confirmed our return flight. We went to the airport and got our boarding passes (should have looked at them at the desk) but when we went to board were told we were in zone 2. Indeed the passes showed seats 24A and B. Went to counter to see what was the reason. Never got a clear reason. Change of plane (was same model as indicated on travel plans) a passenger being moved over (shouldn't we have been given priority?) and some other reason I cannot really recall right now. Let me also point out that our baggage was checked as if we were still first class which would seem odd if we were bumped to economy. Now, they told us we will receive vouchers because of this event (first class) and some refund. We are still awaiting an answer on that and our travel agent is helping. Then, oddly, just before we boarded, a seat opened up in first class. (No, we did not take it as we wanted to sit together) Delta, your service is extremely lacking. You had our contact information and never did so. Your ""explanation"" of the event was so full of holes, cheese cloth, in comparison, is wax paper."

So much time getting things out of overhead racks. People who are changing flights need to sit up front, not in the back of the plane, and I was in the very back of the plane. When I finally exited the plane, I learned that the gate is A49 in another terminal, take an escalator, catch a tram, etc - I have less than 20 minutes. I was running through the airport using escalator, tram, walkways and made it by the seat of my pants. Travel should not be this way!"

No hotel service offered by Delta and non available at 1:30am. Only option was to sleep at the airport. Following morning flight did not board at 8am and was continued to be delayed and told only after the boarding times came and went. Again Delta was not straight forward with the fact that numerous other flights were before ours and they knew the entire time our flight was never going to board at 8am. Renting a car and not going to wait around for Deltas lack of proper communication. Not the first time this has happened due to bad communication about delays!

Delta Platinum reservations are awesome, but they’re the ones trying to get the money. Delta customer service is very lacking. The gentleman was extremely crude and belittling. I’ll comment on the ratings below. Value for money: Delta Economy is always the most expensive compared to other airline economy fares. In the last five months I’ve taken several flights and they’re the only ones grossly delayed. Ground service: Always great. Seat comfort: better than most. Cabin staff service: Always great Food and beverages: airline food Inflight entertainment: needs to be updated more often WiFi: unreliable."

When she returned, I told her our names, she told us we had missed our flight and there was nothing that could be done, that we needed to go over to the phones ""customer service"" to find out when the next flight would be available. My husband and I followed instructions and immediately went to the phones, during this time that I was placed on hold, handing the phone to my husband, I had then witnessed a gentleman in a red coat assist a person onto our plane? Next flight available to Seattle would not be until the following day departing at 3:15. This cost us additional rental car and another expensive nights hotel stay considering it being a weekend with several conventions going on. Our luggage had went on to Seattle along with some very needed medications causing me to flare into a major migraine not able to rid for days, until finally my Dr. was able to give some relief by giving a (nerve block) shot.

Then our plane pulls in, and it is out of service for maintenance. Then they say there is another plane on its way that will take us. Then that plane gets here and there are missing crew members we have to wait on. All in all it was delayed 3 1/2 hours. During all of this, when it is clear I won't make my connecting flight, we talk to customer service who says go ahead and get on the flight and the gate attendant will give you a hotel voucher when you get there because the flight I would be missing is the last one out. We say okay, no problem. I get there and go to the gate attendant. He says, you need to go to customer service. I go to customer service, stand in line for an hour, they say, go to a gate attendant. I go back to a gate attendant. By this time I am so angry and upset I am on the verge of crying, but I am trying to be polite to this innocent gate attendant that is getting caught in the crossfire. She finally takes pity on me, looks it up and says that she will give me a hotel voucher and gives me some tips about when to come back in the morning because it is one of their busiest times. Then I go catch a shuttle to the hotel, but have to wait for the 3rd shuttle because there are so many people in the same situation. Then the hotel has a line out the door to get checked in so by the time I actually get the key to the hotel room, I have three hours before I have to leave for the airport again.

We only had one more hour to go before being able to get home and go to sleep, when Delta happened. Despite troublesome weather, we were still set to depart on time, which was a relief - at first. We boarded the plane, as normal, and then waited. For more than two hours. No acknowledgement was made by Delta that this flight would be late; instead, they kept stating that it would only be another ""10 minutes"" before we could take off. Ten minutes turned into changing the route, having to add fuel (a 45 minute venture) and adding half an hour to the new flight time. Don't fly with Delta. Instead of taking ownership over their mistakes (like not marking the flight as delayed or boarding us despite bad weather) they will instead treat their passengers horribly when they try to figure out what is going on and respond rudely when the passengers question when they will be leaving. Worst flight of my life, and I do not recommend."

I was told there was a schedule change and seats sometimes the seats get scrambled and there was nothing they could do. I could, however, pay additional for 2 premium seats together or ask a stranger to switch me seats.

When I booked the trip I paid one price for myself and a higher price for my mom’s ticket. I was unhappy to over pay for her ticket and had planned to call for a price adjustment on that. By the time I called I checked the current price and it was $30 less than my original ticket and $80 less than my mom’s ticket. When I called to request a price adjustment the lady refused. I think that is a horrible business practice. Southwest would credit me in a minute no questions asked. Instead this lady tries comparing my purchase to buying a pair of jeans at final sale?! It’s not a pair of jeans, it’s a flight that hasn’t even been taken yet! I think it’s disgusting to do that and will never fly Delta again as a result! Don’t think that is worth the price adjustment!"

We did not return home until the following day at 11am. Delta customer service was terrible and did nothing to compensate us for our crisis.

The next flight out was the next morning, we had to get a hotel which was fine, our luggage was no where to be found. We asked for the luggage to be pulled we waited an hour and a half, and found one of our bags out of four. The issue I had was no one was watching the pulled bag area. My brother who’s bag was pulled was sitting in the middle of the terminal unattended. We walked over to the bag and sure enough it was his. No one checked his bag ticket and no one even saw him take it. Very disappointed, and still waiting on three of our four bags, 3 hours later."

Of course, my new allergies started going crazy! The flight attendant was going to upgrade me to first class but there was a dog there also and only God knows if I was allergic to that breed. I was moved to the back of the plane and allergies were kept at a minimum the entire flight. Delta, please come up with some kind of system to inform passengers that animals will be in the main cabin. Had it been a Pekingese dog, we would have had to stop the plane because I wouldn’t have been able to breathe. Seems like a liability suit waiting to happen."

I typically don't fly Delta as I collect points on One World and Star Alliance, however the timing of this flight suited me. In addition it was close to 6 hours long so I was interested in travelling first class. To my surprise the first class ticket was only $200 more than the economy and around half the price of United. The plane was new, the interior and seats nicely appointed, food passable and IFE was excellent. Although the movie selection wasn't great, live TV (including sports) made up for this. For and internal US flight, the fact that it took off and landed on time was a huge unexpected bonus. I will consider moving programs to Skyteam as I think they're impressive."

Delta booked me a hotel at LA in order to get the next flight to Sydney which was planned for next day at 22:30. The problem is that I had to check out from the hotel at 12:00, which means that I had to wait at the airport for 10:30 hours. Delta also gave me one coupon to have lunch (one meal in 24 hours, thanks Delta for keeping me slim). The best part of the story, however, is that I got a seat next to a giant guy so I had to sit in half seat during my flight. I asked several times the crew to take me to another seat, but they couldn't find any, although this was not true (I spotted empty seats 3 & 5 rows in front of me)."

Consequently, by the time I was able to connect to a rep from Dallas, I had missed my flight. She rebooked me on a later flight, with two layovers, and charged me $119.00 for increase in fare. I received an email shortly thereafter that the flight was delayed, and that I may not make my connector flight. Once again, I called a rep who verified such, and she booked me on a flight going out the next day, the same trip I had originally booked, only one day later. I am now told, that even though I didn't take the first rebooked flight, the additional fees were not refundable. It was never brought to my attention that this was the case, I never even printed a ticket for such flight, that may have disclosed this. I will never fly Delta again!"

Celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary in Tahiti. We travel extensively and I submit reviews whenever possible for all types of service, whether for good or bad but with honestly. Flying out of Minneapolis on Delta we sat on the tarmac for over and hour because of mechanical/electrical issues. Even tho the issue was not fixed, de-icing proceeded and we left for take off. Our connecting flight was in LA where we actually made it to the gate with well over 45 minutes before the boarding process. Our bags however, did not make that connection which we discovered upon arrival in Papeete. Took 3 days for Air France to deliver our stuff to Bora Bora. I realize these things happen and feel that Air France was at fault. The issue was ""what airline do I file a reimbursement for necessities""? Air France strung me along for 4 weeks before I finally found someone who indicated Delta would be the one to reimburse. The whole Air France filing process is a joke. So today I received my $194 check from Delta and am extremely happy that I could actually get some compensation. Trust me you do not want to shop in Tahiti on a Sunday for toothpaste/toothbrushes and swimsuits. Thank you Delta, it is much appreciated. On a side note, I would fly Delta again and also Air France where the service and food were exceptional, even back in steerage."

I am writing this review for whoever flies Delta. When you find a deal on say, Expedia, for any Delta flights, before proceeding with your booking, call Delta with the details of that particular flight, ask them to match the price and ensure that the skymiles are added to your account. It seems like the Customer service department is very poorly trained and therefore every representative gives you different information. My message to Delta Airlines is, kindly train your staff well so they know what the heck is going on. Also, it is imperative that Delta customer service agents take responsibility for each other's actions and Delta Airlines as a Whole, rather than saying, its not my department or the Delta agent gave you the wrong information, they didn't know etc. Thank you."

I fly them almost exclusively and have seen their service continue to decline. On this trip outbound from JFK surprising I did not get my upgrade. First problem the cabin interior was old and stodgy. The entertainment system needed to be rebooted twice and the GOGO WiFi was a NOGO. Worst of all my seat did not recline. Lovely for a transcon flight. On my return I got my upgrade but shockingly the tray table in my premium economy seat was broken. I had to eat from my lap. In all my travels never had a tray table been broken in an upgrade section of a plane. Especially on an important business route. I’m taking my business elsewhere to try someone else.

When I booked tickets on the Delta website earlier this year to fly from London to Costa Rica I got all the way to the final screen without any problems only to find that when I clicked 'Buy' a pop up screen appeared telling me that there was now a high demand for these seats and if I wanted them I'd have to pay a couple of hundred dollars more. Delta might find this to be a great way to screw extra money out of your customers (and after all, they are an American company) and it might even be legal; but it's dishonest, unethical and just plain wrong. I've never known this from any other airline in over 40 years of flying. Secondly, as we flew over the Atlantic my wife and I were on the extreme right hand side of the plane, the guy on the same row in seat A had his window open - everyone else had their windows closed as the sun was low and very bright. This caused everyone in the row to have very bright sunlight in their eyes, we all complained to the stewardess who told us that the guy needed to work on his computer and so needed the window open to see the keyboard, I have to note that the window was partially closed so there was no sunlight in his eyes, just everyone elses. No matter how many times we complained the stewardess refused to tell the guy to close the window, so this went on for several hours, it made it difficult to see the entertainment, it made it impossible to sleep and it  made the whole experience very unpleasant.  Given the way several US airlines have treated their passengers over the past year I doubt that I'll ever fly on an American carrier again, they obviously don't care about passengers. As a further point, Atlanta airport is the biggest dump I've ever had to spend any time in, I'll avoid it like the plague in future"

I sat patiently to get my flight at 8 when it was announced that the flight is delayed and would go only at 10. The plane came in late and we boarded and was to leave at 10.20. But captain announced they are waiting on some equipment alignment and kept the plane oh hold without any further announcement. It’s gong to be 11pm now and the flight is still grounded.

The flight attendant refused to help and told me to exit the plane and speak to the gate agent who also refused to assist. There were 20 open seats on the plane two in the “comfort area” which they refused to let us use. Second leg my daughter was seated two rows from her two year old. Ended up there were duplicate tickets and she had to put him on her lap for a two and a half hour flight. Keep in mind she paid for a seat. No customer service in either case.

Me and my husband booked our flights from Tel Aviv to Portland and vice versa via CheapOair, flying with KLM, Delta  and Air France. The departing flights with a layover in Amsterdam ( with KLM) were great, however the returning flights operated by Delta and Air France were an horrendous experience! It began 2 days before our departure. We received an email notification that our returning flights have been rescheduled. We were not satisfied with the change, and spent more than an hour on an international call with cheapOair customer service to make sure we will depart at the original time and will remain seated together. While booking we paid to CheapOair to ensure we will be seated together, and they ensured us that even though the assigned seats may change, we will be together. In the updated itinerary all seemed OK, and we left for our trip thinking it is. When we checked in to our departing flights the evening before (3 flights with layovers in Seattle and Paris) we were shocked to see we were seated separately in all of them! Air France from Paris to Tel Aviv was the worst, with me being seated in the first rows and my husband in the back. What was even worse is we saw on one of the flights there was a free seat next to my husband, but to choose it meant to pay 60$ extra. Why would they separate us in the first place when there were seats available? Were we suppose to pay for something we already paid for?! We tried to call to Delta customer service, only to wait for more than 2 hours. Left our local sim number and they called back after 3 hours, said they transfer me to international flights customers service, and this time had to wait for another half an hour, left my number and they never called back. Our layovers were very short and we were nervous we won't be able talk with Delta representatives in the airports on time When we got to the airport at Portland, there were no Delta representatives to talk to. Next to the gate however were phones direct to customer service, on which luckily there wasn't any wait time, but the representative wasn't very helpful. When she was told all that we've been through she was silent and couldn't help us reassign the seats. She sent us to the gate to try and fix that. At the gate, representative got us new seats together on our flights from USA to Paris in a few moments. When asked what was the problem to do so from the beginning, she blamed it on Air France in Paris rescheduling one of the original flights and said it also caused the mess with the seats. She also couldn't reassign our seats from Paris to Tel Aviv. When boarded on the plane to Paris, we had a delay of a half an hour because safety buckles were missing and waited for the crew to bring it. After a long wait, apparently they brought the wrong buckles and had to return with the right once. We were afraid we were going to miss our next flight. The flight to Tel Aviv was not any better. Once again, there were seats together we were reassigned to without any problem, and yet again there was a delay of half an hour after boarding because the water system of the plane needed to be checked. Lucky we didn't miss our flights and got home safely! What bothered us the most, however, is that changing our seats seemed like a deliberate move to try make us pay more. Obviously there's no respect for customers. Flying with low cost companies is better than Delta!"

We were then told no flight was available til 7:00 am the next day and we’d be given hotel vouchers, but would need to be back at the airport by 5:00 am. The line to get the vouchers had several hundred people in it because Delta had screwed up other flights that night and stretched practically outside the bldg. it took several hours to get through the line (because Delta only had 3 people working the desk) which meant that by the time most passengers got the vouchers it was too late to go to the hotel. In addition, we were told that we could get a later flight but needed to call Delta. When we did, we were told hold times were over 2 hours! The vast majority of passengers ended up having to sleep in the airport. Total incompetence by Delta in every way. The few staff that were on hand were impatient and rude.

The volume was also way too quiet and I could barely hear my movie over people coughing loudly. The second segment from ATL to SFO was much worse despite being only half as long. Boarding took forever and I got stuck sitting next to a man with a nasty cold. His constant loud coughing/sneezing/grunting made it impossible for me to sleep on the near-red eye flight. When we landed it took 30 minutes before we went up to the gate. For some reason that always happens every time I fly Delta. Anyway, baggage claim also took longer than usual because an announcement said the cargo door was having difficulty opening properly and because the carousel wasn't decided until the last second. I'm never flying Delta again unless they upgrade their aircraft and stop overestimating the arrival times. My flight to SFO was estimated to be 6 hours, so the ground staff at the destination prepared for that duration. But since the actual flight time was only 5 hours, we had to wait longer to go up to the gate. By the way, the 737 used for the second flight segment was much more cramped than the ones used by United, and I flew first class."
1777,3,,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to Boston,April 2018,1,1,,,2,,3,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Seattle to Boston. I used my company’s travel agency to switch my flight back to Boston to the red eye. I didn’t realize that the agency booked me in the row in front of the emergency exit, meaning the seats in that row don’t recline and it would require me trying to sleep while sitting at a 90 degree angle. There were many open seats after takeoff so I moved to the row in front of me. There was one man in that row in the aisle seat, and his wife was adjacent in another empty row. He very reluctantly allowed me to pass him to sit in the window seat of his row after I explained I wanted to sleep before returning to work in Boston the next morning. Not 20 minutes after I had fallen asleep, the Emporer of aisle 15 had gotten the flight attendant to ask me to evacuate “his” row. The attendant said that I was sitting in an economy plus row. No problem; I did not pay for an economy plus ticket and was more than happy to move to any other row with a reclining chair. I asked her to please tell me where I can move to another open seat. “Sure”, she says, and walks away. I gather my belonging and she comes back to say rudely “You have to move”. I asked if she knew which seat I could move to, and she said there should be some in the back. Super helpful. The only open economy seat was at the very back row which also didn’t recline."

I was very pleasantly surprised. All six flights were on schedule. Transfer at busy Atlanta was smooth. Flight attendants were welcoming. Leg space was adequate. Cabin was clean and bright. Ground staff at the gates were accommodating. In flight service offered a choice of four snack items. Luggage was brought out quickly enough jet side on arrival. IFE offered various choices - bring your own earphones.
1779,4,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Anchorage to Minneapolis,April 2018,2,2,3,4,3,3,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ," The last three Delta flights I have been on have always been delayed due to 'mechanical errors'. Being that Delta tickets are more expensive you would think they would have nicer planes. The last flight I was on was delayed for two hours while we were sitting on the runway and the captain of the flight didn’t even tell us what was going on. The flight leaving to Minneapolis from Anchorage was delayed by almost 6 hours! Seriously, they have a record of being the most delayed, slow and honestly the worst communication to their passengers. Since I live in Alaska there are very few airlines to choose from but if I had a choice I would avoid flying with them at all cost."
1780,3,,Business,Premium Economy,Boston to Amsterdam,April 2018,2,3,2,3,4,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Boston to Amsterdam. This review is for the Premium Economy. First, I did not see the difference with the economy until I noticed a little red strip on the seats. When asked, they are said to have more space between rows. Not very visible. Especially since you are in the same cabin, same food. By the way, now access to priority lane or else. Just a boarding before economy. I fail to see the advantage. Due to poor choice, crazy price, and a time constraint I had no choice but to take this airline and premium eco. I ll avoid this airline like the plague. One last thing. I asked on both way to be upgraded, I was ready to pay for it. Not possible! You have to do it 72h before - even in the 80s some airlines were upgrading you at the boarding desk."

1782,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lihue to Portland via Seattle,April 2018,2,2,,,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified , Our flight from Kauai to Seattle left my family and me with a 4 hour layover before departing to Portland. (It only takes 2.5 hours to drive). A Delta flight with many seats available was departing 2 hours earlier. Delta however charges a $75 dollar standby fee per ticket to be bumped up to the earlier flight. Thats more than the cost of the original tickets. For a family of 4 thats an additional $300. This is why we will never fly Delta again.

Horrible customer service. I also flew Delta into Hawaii and the flight attendants were horrible and extremely unhelpful with helping me get overhead bin space, they would not help me figure out where my connecting gate was even though I had only 20 minutes to make that flight. On the way back the flight attendants were more helpful but when I arrived into LAX there was a flight leaving for SFO shortly so I asked if I could take the earlier flight so as to avoid waiting 2 hours in an overcrowded waiting room that did not have enough seats. I was told there was room and I could get on the earlier flight. Then my name was looked up and they told me that since I had an economy ticket I could not change anything and could not get on the earlier flight. I have never heard of an airline doing this - regardless of your ticket type, why would I not be able to get on the exact same flight 2 hours earlier while I was in the airport with no checked luggage. I am furious and will no longer be flying Delta."

I went from smiles and people willing to lend a hand to help us find where we were going to Delta employees who look at you not smiling, not engaging at all in conversation for directions, a lady who told me to keep watching the board for help and walked off. So very unprofessional! I loved my flight until I reached Atlanta and there found out I'm only a number."
1785,2,,Business,Premium Economy,Boston to Columbus,April 2018,3,4,3,2,3,4,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Airlines like Delta don't actually care about their customers. The lower level staff members generally do, but the company itself and higher ups (aka policy makers) clearly don't. The customer support team and staff agents are virtually powerless and can't really help customers when it matters. Policies are in place to prevent the customer support team from helping the customers by doing simple things like waiving fees or making flight changes easier. The only thing it seems like staff members have the authority to do is provide customers with an extra set of Biscoffs during in-flight service. It's unfortunate because I used to love Delta but now feel a strong sense of distrust and dissatisfaction with the brand. I don't matter to Delta and neither does my brand loyalty. The employees seemingly aren't allowed to make any changes that aid customers unless they charge them an arm and a leg first due to the company policies. Delta customer support doesn't actually help customers without charging them fees for ridiculous things like flight change despite already having forced customers to pay upwards for $25 dollars extra."

Boarding ran smoothly and upon boarding the entire plane the flight crew mentioned a circuit problem in the cockpit. We were never told what the estimated delay time would be. After an hour of sitting on the plane we were told to deplane. The flight was going to be delayed for an hour and then when boarding time came around another 2 hours. At this point we are 4 hours out from our original departure time. Right as boarding was supposed to begin another hour was added to the delay. This is my first time flying alone. I am 18, unfamiliar with this airport. The pilot told us they checked the circuit at 7.10, when they realized there was an issue, 5 minutes before we were supposed to leave! Why wasn’t this examined prior to boarding an entire plane of people? This is unprofessional and inconsiderate of customers time and money. Not to mention that this was a connecting flight causing issues for many people on the plane to miss their next flight in Atlanta. I still have not boarded, so chances are that the flight will be delayed another hour. Bad service."

I am not sure why I keep trying to fly Delta. I know this time it was to try to get home a little earlier. I seem to always regret it. This time I gate checked my bag to have it left on the tarmac. When I saw it, the employees would not give it to me saying that they could not give it to us because they didn't ""know"" that it was mine. Never mind that I could identify the bag and its contents!! Instead, we had to leave the terminal and claim it at baggage claim (how do they know it is my bag there when they have ripped off the tag) and then go back through TSA (always fun) to try to make my connection. The last time I flew Delta they wanted my 5 year old son to sit 10 rows away from me. Thanks to a kind fellow travelers, we were able to sit together. Delta simply said ""sorry""."

Upon boarding the plane, crew said ""Welcome, glad to have you aboard!"" Flight took off with no problems, brand new plane. Free snacks and soft drinks during flight. The attendants were super-friendly, polite and professional. They were genuinely happy to be helping us and doing their job. Landed into LaGuardia with no delay, arrived at gate and deplaned with no issues. Overall, a perfect flight. Nice work, Delta!"

I am 8 months pregnant, we’d had an awful experience in Mexico and had an extremely short layover to our next flight. They were extremely professional and kind. They cared well for my husband and I!!! They showed us kindness we weren’t expecting and made sure I was feeling well with the pregnancy. And one of them gave me a genuine hug which was more impactful than anything I’d experienced all week. So we just wanted to say thank you and rave about how wonderful they were! Please continue to hire such amazing caretakers."

I booked Delta Air Lines with the impression that Atlanta is their headquarters. Their app on iOS is useless. Gate details, seat number were never updated! You have to visit their website to check-in the flight. Cannot be done through app. Make sure that you sign up for alerts. The seats in economy were cramped just like every other airlines. As soon as they turned on the AC, air inside started smelling gas. That alone made me feel like running out of the plane. Flight was delayed by more than 1 hr. Then waited for another hour for takeoff. During the flight, entertainment provided was ok (movies, TV, games) like every other airline. Landing was big problem compared to the other airlines I have travelled (American, Virgin). "
1792,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Daytona to Philadelphia,March 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Flew Daytona to Philadelphia. Delta Air Lines is the epitome of a greedy corporation. They stuff as many passengers on a plane without regard to their comfort at all. It seems after every terrible flight I fly with Delta, the seats and leg space get smaller and smaller. The crew are unpleasant and seem to hate their jobs more than most hate Delta. They nickle and dime you for everything and even have a scam to try and get people to pay extra for seats they could have for free. They have a ridiculous charge of $75 if you wish to switch to an earlier flight, which is crazy considering the fact that the seats are already available. They claim to have free WiFi on board but it has not worked on a single Delta flight I have been on. Do not fly Delta if you can avoid. The experience is truly terrible and makes me hate traveling."

I am 5'6' tall, and we flew on the A/B two-seat side of the 767 configured either 2-4-2 or 2-5-2 (don't remember the middle aisle well). Delta now has the seat rows so closely packed that my knees barely cleared the row in front of me. The woman behind me was quite tall. I could not recline my seat at all during the 3 hour flight because she was so crammed in that her knees were jammed right up against my seat back. Too bad Delta isn't making enough money that they need to pack the planes even further."

How many times has Delta left me stranded, exhausted and furious? Let me count the ways! I think collectively at least 6-8 I've had issues with Delta today it was an airplane malfunction where we were deplaned, rerouted and then re-boarded, 6 hours later I'm supposed to be home hours ago for a very important meeting and Delta could care less, they told us they were buying us food which never happened, so after missing 2 connecting flights I ask if I could get a better seat not next to the toilet in the back and they (very defensive attendant) told me there's no upgrades. Give me a break!! I'm never giving my business to Delta again! In fact I have a ticket booked for the future, I will be cancelling and finding an alternative carrier. Delta, not worth the savings. Oh and a brand new plane and my knees were crushed against the front seat!!"

I am a 6-ft, 62 yr old woman with MS and after flying on United to Paris that I would never fly to Europe unless I flew Premium Economy. From ATL to LHR on Virgin was ok, but not as great as the reviews said. However, the flight back on Delta was awful. Seats were so crammed together in Premium Economy that my knees touched the seat in front of me before the passenger put the seat back. Both and and the woman next to me had checked our seats no more than 1 hour before take-off (not boarding) to make sure we were seated next to an empty seat. Both of us were told the site that was the case. Actually, the entire seating chart showed a very sparsely populated cabin. Not the case. It was packed. I believe they tried to make up for the horrible food with sheer volume. There was more really awful food than I'd seen in quite some time, and I will eat anything. The WiFi didn't work. The toilets were not clean. I will never fly Delta again. Worst 8 hours I've ever spent on a plane."
1797,1,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Atlanta,March 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Delta Air Lines is the worst airline of all time. I cannot believe how they over book their flights and seats that were paid for months ago are now in limbo, that is messed up. I bought 2 tickets with the intent to sit next to my fiance and instead I was placed sitting across the aisle in the middle of two passengers, people I do not know. This type of insecurity and un-reliability is extremely poor. I will never fly again with Delta."

Here are some of the good and bad about that flight: The Good: - Staff always nice - Pillow (low quality) and blanket (very good quality) available at each seat. Bottle of water provided - Clean airplane. The Bad: - Announced on time but boarded 20 minutes late (would have preferred to say in lounge an additional 20 minutes instead of standing at gate) - Sitting in the back of 1st Class did not get my choice of meal. I wish I could pre-order like with AA - Online IFE would not load correctly so besides a good selection of movies, I could not watch any (tried multiple browser on a laptop and iPad). Very limited choice of snacks Leg room: Average Recline: Good."

I forgot my jacket with house keys and upon arrival at Atlanta half an hour later tried to call into Chattanooga to ask the attendants to pickup the jacket. I asked several attendants and a customer service manager in Atlanta for help, but no one could be bothered, just said to file a report online. Delta never picked up the jacket, or what they did with an old Army coat I will never know. Very disappointed, they could care less about the passengers. I had to replace my house keys and business keys."

I did not know this and I thought I did not need to be on look out for this since I was dealing with Delta. Wrong. I bought 4 tickets and two of them are for my kids. Because of this deception now my kids are going to be sitting with strangers in the middle seats. The cost per leg of our trip to pick our seats is $120 per ticket. The cost to pick our seats would be $960. Flying Delta is like flying on Spirit now. Be careful when you make your reservation, Delta is deceptive."

Arrived at Hyatt Ziva with five friends and learned that they only had 1 room booked under our reservation when we had booked 3. Delta stated our reservation only had 1 and refused to help. This was even after we demonstrated to the representative that it is impossible to book the Hyatt Ziva with 6 people in one room. The hotel will not even come up as an option on the Delta Vacations website if you put that # of people in one room. The hotel supervisor said that she had not seen this happen in her 15 years working there. It is against hotel policy to book more than 4 to a room. They made a special exception to make sure we weren't sleeping on the street. There was an obvious error on Delta's fault and they did nothing to help remedy the situation. We took turns sleeping on the floor and even outside on the room's balcony. Delta is unwilling to take responsibility.

It was an honest mistake of mine and, after 4 days in NYC, we were exhausted and ready to get home. Not to mention both having work the next day and no extra money for an outrageous change fee.

He was going to divert the plane to a nearby airport and had already lowered the altitude. They had an EMS waiting for us at the gate, and they took him directly to a hospital. To sum it up, the attention he got during this medical emergency was second to none. The stewardesses were very attentive and caring."

I'll avoid using Delta in future. I knew that US carriers have a bad reputation for quality and service, so I gave them a chance (also other carriers, not just Delta) because of the low price. However, I'll definitely stick with European, Asian or Middle Eastern carriers in future. The cabin crew were friendlier and more courteous to each other than they were to passengers. When serving food and drink they would have thrown the items at passengers if they could. Service felt rushed and items were dropped onto tray tables, not placed. When serving from the drinks cart, some flight attendants maintained a conversation with each other and didn't even look at passengers when serving - they just looked straight ahead at each other, with their arm held out to the side, waiting for passengers to take the plastic cup from them. That kind of body language is a display of contempt and disdain. Some were more polite than others, but none were in the same league as flight attendants from Asian or Middle Eastern carriers. Unfriendly cabin crew are a common feature among US airline companies. Their boarding process is inefficient. They board by zone number (which is printed on your boarding pass). Your zone is related to how much you paid for your ticket, not the section of the aircraft you're seated in (as it's done on better quality airlines). It would make much more sense to board by row number, starting at the rear to prevent blocking the aisles, as this would reduce waiting times."

Delayed in Seattle for 5.5 hours and offered no compensation for expenses incurred because of the delay. To make matters worse, they kept telling us we’d be leaving in 45 mins, so many of us didn’t know we could/should make other arrangements. On the flight from Hawaii, we were delayed an hour (stuck on a hot plane). Attendants served water to the front of the plane twice, but didn’t serve economy anything during the delay or at all until 2 hours into the flight. Parched and miserable!

1813,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Hartford,March 2018,3,3,3,3,1,,2,0,✅ Trip Verified ," Atlanta to Hartford. Customer service at the gate was lacking to say the least. I waited in line for 25 minutes to ask a question about figuring out my seat assignment as my ticket said to check in at the gate for my assigned seat. Staff stated multiple times that there was “no need to stand in line if you have questions about the flight as I won’t be open to questions about this flight for another 10 minutes”. The flight she was talking about was headed to Florida and was not my flight. I continued to wait patiently as she continued to repeat her statement about not waiting in line for questions. Finally I said to her that I had a question about the next flight out, not the current one. To which she replied, well I don’t know anything about that flight. My response was to ask her if she knew anything about the gate check in seating and how that works as I’ve never encountered that before. And her response was beyond dismissive and rude. She waved her hands on the air saying “how would I know anything about that, just go to customer service” as she walked away from the gate with a line of at least 4 customers behind me. She is an extremely poor representation of Delta and, in my humble opinion, should not be working anywhere with people or customer service. She was offensively impolite, snide, and I was left unhelped in any way. Based on my interaction alone I would not recommend Delta to anyone."

Both times we dealt with cancelled flights and delays due to mechanical problems. The people that work for Delta Air Lines were not helpful. We even got yelled at by the person working at the special services desk. There is no compensation either. We were told we would have to stay till the next day but the hotel would be at our cost. Or we could fly to a different city but the rental car to get home would also be our cost. Don't fly with Delta. I would rather walk!

We got on the airplane only to find out there was a leak in the aircraft. We sat on the runway for 2 hours in a freezing cold cabin and not allowed to stand up. The flight attendants were incredibly rude. One was grabbing something from the overhead compartment and dropped a suitcase on my head. She didn’t even apologize! Passengers around me were asking if I was ok and the flight attendant just walked away. Delta should do a better job with hiring and reviewing all of their aircraft before departure.

The gate agent kept us informed regularly and once the plane was at the gate, they very quickly cleaned the plane and had us board in a quick and orderly fashion. The plane was a newer one and had the monitors which were terrific for watching movies. They had a huge selection of old and really new movies. The flight went by very quickly for all of us. The return flight was on time and went just fine. The staff were courteous and helpful every step of the way."

I had a family issue and had Military travel book my ticket for me. I called Delta today to see if I could reschedule the ticket due to the family issues changing a little; expecting to pay a penalty or transfer fee. Instead I was told I would have to just eat that money and no money would be applied to any other use with Delta. They would not even work with me on this. I have booked several tickets before and have spent $$$$$ with delta. I have never been told I would end up having to eat 100% of the money I bought this ticket with.

First of all, even if you are Gold Member of Flying Blue you cannot have access to the Delta lounge at JFK Terminal 4, because you are flying on domestic route. What is this policy? It is not written in any place of their lounge? Also United and Air France are not working like that. Thank you Delta Air Lines for taking care of your customers. Secondly, flight has been delayed 2h30 for a flight duration of 45min. No excuse from Delta Airlines.

I could have flown home to an emergency (they even asked for the hospitals name and number to verify, who does that?! But I wasn't lying, so I obliged.

Marie that was delayed due to weather Delta kept stringing all the passengers along that they were trying to get another flight to go to Sault in the early morning of the next day. They gave us a coupon for a hotel since we all had to stay the night, but the coupon was only $1 off the regular price. When I followed up the next morning their helpline informed me that a request for an additional flight was never even submitted. They didn’t even try to get people there in a timely manner and instead are making people wait to (hopefully) get in around midnight the next day. This is over a full 24 hrs that we have been stuck in the airport loosing money since we have to take additional days off work now and spending more since we had to get a hotel and meals on our own dime. I would recommend to never flying with Delta unless you enjoy being given the run around."

Delta was beyond belief this past weekend. I was already annoyed that I had a connecting flight, so I booked an early in order to make an appointment in San Diego, CA. My outbound flight to MSP was delayed so much that I missed the connecting flight to SAN. Once I arrived in MSP, I was directed to the service desk for assistance. The Service Desk agent displayed absolutely no empathy and told me my next flight out was going to be with an additional connection through LAX. So I was originally going to get to SAN around 1pm. Now with the delays and re-route this was going to push me back to 9pm. I asked at the service desk if they compensate their customers in any way and she said ""Well, if you were here more than 8 hours we would give you a meal voucher and Delta feels if they get you there within 24 hours then that is the best they can do."" Her words, not mine. I was floored. So I asked her to terminate my trip in LAX and I would get my own transportation from there to SAN instead of sitting in the airport another two hours. I get to LAX and no bag! I ran like a mad woman to baggage services so that they could keep my bag from going on the connecting flight to SAN. The agent there was emotionless as he put a note in the computer and he told me to wait 20 minutes until they respond. I said ""Uhm, can you call them please? I would like to get my bag and leave."" He said ""ok."" I mean why do I have to instruct you on how to extend good customer service? He called and my bag was produced within the next few minutes. I tried to purchase a ticket on another carrier for my return flight home in a couple of days, but they were just too expensive. But I can guarantee, I will not fly Delta ever again after this. It seems like the airlines, Delta, American, and United included only treat you with a small sense of dignity when you have status within their frequent flyer program. So sad, but true."

No delays, good service by the flight attendants and a reasonable price one way 98 USD. The problem was the overpricing of the baggage. PR got devastated by a monster hurricane Maria and my family needed a generator and my sister did the same route and same airline and payed 25 dollars for the same generator. I left 2 weeks later (October 29th 2017) and paid 70 dollars for it. In general Delta is fine except the baggage overcharging in a emergency situation in PR."

My flight into SLC was delayed just long enough to miss my connection to my home town, for the fourth time in a row. As usual, the only options Delta suggested required me to pay out of pocket, for a hotel or rental car. Somehow, no matter what the cause of my missed flight is, they have exempted themselves from offering any sort of compensation (“Oh, we can’t do anything about that.”) This time they did change my flight to a nearby city, but with no way of making it home from there. It kind of seems like an attempt to look like they are trying to help while actually being the opposite of helpful, unless stranding me with no way home is considered helpful. Unfortunately, my employer books exclusively through Delta, so I will likely go through this again. SLC plays loud piano music all night, with regular security announcements. I guess they want to make sure no one stranded at their airport overnight has the chance to get a little sleep. Four trips in a row that were pretty enjoyable until the last little bit, then it’s all ruined by incompetence."

I flew to FL 18 years ago on a different airline and vowed to never fly again. All in all I never enjoyed flying it was just a means to a destination. I made a snap decision to travel with family to see family, tickets bought no backing out. It was a beautiful flight so much so i spent a lot of time looking out the window watching the flight navigator on the seat back so i knew exactly what city were were flying over. We were all seated together on a fully packed flight as well which was a bonus! Although we were in Economy we were treated with the same respect as first class! The Pilot was great, flight attendants were great, snacks were just right. The plane itself was stunning to see inside and out. Spacious, clean, plenty of leg room with free in flight movies, games and much more on every seat back. Headphones were not included but only $2 to purchase. Usually after flying i made myself forget the flight! Now i'm actually looking forward to flying with Delta again! Thank you Delta for a wonderful (non-terrifying) much needed family vacation! I'll be back!"

It left on time, arrived early and the cabin crew tried very hard to provide wonderful service with the bare minimum they were given to work with. Incredibly as I reached baggage claim my bag appeared. Considering the five hour flight time,the seat was acceptable enough and the catering merely surprising. Everything else was top notch."
1829,1,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Richmond, Virginia to Edinburgh, UK",October 2017,3,4,3,4,1,,1,0,✅ Trip Verified ," We flew over for my Mother's 85th birthday and though we'd try Delta as they fly directly from the UK to the States. We paid higher than the ""going rate"" for our flight especially because we wanted a smooth overnight return so that we could return to work the day after return. The flight over was very good, we were impressed. But, our connection from Richmond to our NY overseas flight was suddenly cancelled. The ground crew hardly knew how to cope with such. They claimed it much be weather, though had no idea. As their flights to other NY airports were flying, and the weather report looked fine this could not be the case. After much back and forth we were routed through Atlanta (still suffering from the hurricanes) and then Amsterdam. This was the longest return we'd ever experienced in our 30 years of regular travel between the UK/US. Needless to say we could not return to work the following day as planned. So initially we were very disappointed at how poorly Delta handled our return. We can only assume that the flight was cancelled because they hadn't the numbers, and thus the profit. This was the first clue of a problem. The confused and almost useless ground staff the second clue. Note that we had to work with them for a realistic return as their initial proposal did not allow adequate lay-over time in Atlanta given the airport size. Then on return I wrote a complaint to Delta. Next clue was that complaints are automated through a soulless computer process. Then I was warned that they were experiencing a high volume to customer service requests and while they hoped to answer in 30 days they could not promise. 30+ days, seriously? Well they passed our complaint, about Delta's handling of our custom, over the KLM who few the transatlantic flight. They must never had even read the complaint. Since then we've had two emails from KLM about how they are too busy to reply but will soon. So now it is almost 4 months after a complaint and nothing. Just so disappointing. Will never fly Delta again if this is what happens when there's a problem."

Delta One is decent as a transcontinental business product. On the Boeing 767-300 it is a 1-2-1 staggered layout. However, the shell of each seat is way too short, creating a less private experience. The catering service was great. Three entree options were provided and were accompanied by an appetizer, a salad, a soup, and some deserts afterwards. Delta uses Westin's Heavenly bedding onboard all of their Delta One flights which was very comfortable. However, the poor design of the seat caused the situation where there was no room for my feet to move when the seat is in its lie-flat position. The flight crew was very friendly. Onboard Wi-Fi was useable but extremely slow. The overall experience of this flight is not bad and I would definitely fly Delta One for transcontinental flights if good pricing is available."

She announced the flight delay on the intercom & said we would take off in 10 min. 10 min later, she announced the same exact thing with the same amount of time. During flight as she was passing out snacks & beverages, she purposely walked pass my aisle with my brother without offering goods & commented, ""Oh, you didn't say anything so I assumed you didn't want anything."" As a flight attendant, you are obligated to accomodate your passengers by asking about their needs & promoting their offers first hand. Overall she just had rude, uncaring behavior."

I'm not complaining about our flight being rebooked, or anything else weather related. I am complaining because I spoke with and saw a number of Delta representatives, all of which were told we were traveling with infants and none of them printed infant tickets causing us to be seconds away from missing our flight sucks. Our luggage was lost in JFK (I say lost because no one could tell me where it was) and the average wait to get luggage was 1.5-2 hours and we had to wait 4. Our items were damaged and missing the Delta representatives are clearly sick of speaking with customers because they are all extremely rude and have just run out of care to give to their customers. So Delta you clearly owe your reps some lunch or a bonus or something because they are making matters so much worse by just not caring. Now I have filled a claim online for my damaged items however the website would only accept one upload, so I have no idea if you got the picture of the damaged personal items, luggage, or car seat but I'll be more than happy to go over all the information with someone in the estimated 6-8 weeks I was told it would take for a Delta claim member to follow up."

My initial flight was from RDU to SEA on 01/08/18 early morning reaching SEA at 9:30am. Then Delta had a scheduled flight change and the arrival time in SEA got changed to 10:20am. I had an important meeting to attend at noon on 01/08 so I requested Delta to put me on a flight on 01/07 night instead which they did. My new flight was from RDU to SEA via ATL with a stopover of 45 minutes. The flight from RDU to ATL got delayed by 15 minutes. The RDU ATL flight arrived at gate B18 and the ATL SEA flight was from gate E6. Why would they even suggest such an itinerary with 45 minutes of stopover. I ran my heart out and reached gate E6 10 minutes before departure but the door had already closed. There were plenty of other passengers with me. Could they not have waited for 10 more minutes? Was it so difficult to see that there are other people connecting to this flight who had landed just 10 minutes before, more so given the fact that the flight was the last flight for the night to SEA from ATL? After that, I got rebooked on a flight to SEA via SLC reaching SEA at 12:30pm on 01/08. So basically the reason why I prepone my flight to 01/07 in order to reach on time for my meeting, you are now taking me to SEA even after my original direct flight from RDU to SEA. I told the gate agent about that and she was outright rude. I said I have to attend the meeting and I will take a non delta flight and reach SEA on time for my meeting. She told me that I wont get any refund since I am already rebooked on a different flight. So basically I ended up spending the whole night in ATL, waiting 4 hours in the terminal to get my bag out, and then ended up taking a 6:15am Alaska flight to SEA. I would never ever travel on Delta again. This was the worst experience I ever had and the gate agents and customer support is no good and outright rude."

By Sunday, our bag hadn't arrived and we had spent four plus hours on hold collectively. We arrived at the airport for our return trip, hoping to collect our bag there and depart. At one terminal, we were given the exact location of the bag and when we arrived there, were asked to wait for over an hour to get the location of the bag, which I already had.

After arriving at San Diego International Airport at 430am for my 7am departure our flight was delayed over and hour. This delay was not due to weather. We landed at JFK Airport and we waited well over a half hour to even get off to a gate to de-board. This caused me to miss my layover to Syracuse, NY. Although Delta did pay for the next flight out to Syracuse, NY via Delta airlines, this turned into a 4 hour layover. Now that we are finally ready to depart from JFK and finally on my way home after an exhausting day of unexpected travel, we are again delayed not due to weather but waiting an another plan to land so other customers can make this connecting flight. We were supposed to depart at 856 and it's been 40 minutes. Yes, I'm frustrated but also upset due to the inconsistency of the airline - why couldn't my Delta connection wait for all the passengers from JFK to Syracuse instead of leaving right at that moment."

Waiting for cabin crew to prep - no cabin crew as they’ve finished their shift and we have to wait for the next cabin crew at unknown time of arrival Boarded a few people, then made them come off the plane as it was “too cold” as the engine had no fuel! Pilot didn’t even know how long it’d take. We have all collectively concluded that none of this was true and later found out that flights to London never take off from the gates we were made to hopscotch between. Then on the 7th hour at 2am we were told that the next flight was at 6:30PM. Queued for 3hrs just to ask a question which took us to 5am. With 13hrs wait time ahead of us, we were unable to leave and with zero facilities here, no shops open, no hotel rooms nearby, rude useless staff who kicked sleeping mothers and children out of airline lounges. Overheated space with nowhere to sit, no water offered and no care to those with young children. I saw so many dismissed and sent away from the airport without any care. Absolutely disgusted by all this. Only this morning they took the initiative to give out some drinks and muffins to those with newly delayed flights. Clearly the media’s hitting hard but what about the rest of us who endured 12hrs last night, held hostage and treated like cattle in dirt with no food or bedding? Utterly disgusting and to top it all off, my sister just asked for a pillow from a Delta employee and her rude response was “I was handing them out at 2 last night, they’re all gone, what do you want me to do about it?” No care, no kindness, no sympathy - just a mockery of what we’re having to go through."

I purchased 5 first class tickets from Georgia to Colorado with a connection in Atlanta. Circumstances led my sister to need to fly out of Atlanta and return in Atlanta. (We knew we were losing the extra money for her Savannah flights but she was keeping her same seat on her Atlanta flights) I waited on hold for three hours to let Delta know she will no longer need the flights I paid for from Savannah to Atlanta and from Atlanta to Savannah. I was then informed it would cost an additional $448 to allow her to check in in Atlanta. As a result, she drove 3.5 hours to Savannah to make the Savannah flight. The day before the flight, I tried to check all of us in; however, my sister was no longer on the itinerary anywhere. So i waited an additional 1.5 hours to see why she was no longer on the itinerary. Turns out the delta rep who tried to change her flight information gave her a different itinerary number. To compensate, Delta gave us a $100 voucher to use to purchase any delta tickets. On the flight home she did not board as she needed to stay in Atlanta. So I allowed my nephew to sit in her seat that I already paid for. Deltas employees then made him get up and go to his assigned seat in the main cabin so one of their pilots could sit in the first class seat I paid for! Very unfortunate that Deltas employees choose to make sure they are comfortable rather than the paying customers. Extremely disappointed in this airline. I will not be recommending this airline and will try to avoid using Delta for future flights."

Delayed both of my flights one by 45 mins, the other by 1.5 hours because they didn't consider that a plane would need to be deiced in December flying through the Midwest or east coast - they delayed it 3 different times. Each flight they didn't tell me the 3rd time it got delayed, I found out at the airport. The first flight they didn't say anything at all at the counter I had to find it on a TV after we hadn't started boarding when we were supposed to, customer service is rude, they don't care about their customers, the boarding agents are angry and aggressive. Miserable experience and will never fly with them again"

A nice Delta employee tried to check me in anyway but then later she said they can't open the gates since flight is sold out and she said I must call WestJet. I called WestJet, on hold etc back and forth with them, to make a long story short they told me I must re-book with Delta who again (different person) they cannot help me and I must call WestJet. Out of frustration I left the airport since I wasn't getting anywhere and it had been 2 hours of trying to book another flight. I later booked with Expedia out of desperation since I needed to get back home to Calgary and flew out the next day same flight same airline (Westjet operated by Delta). No one will compensate me. I'm very disappointed that Delta would not help me that day."

When we arrived at the airport, it was an absolute mess with little staff and loads of people trying to check in and get through security. It was unclear what we were supposed to do and we waited for a long time before realising that we were supposed to use the e-kiosk for check in. Boarding was also an absolute mess with no clear line or anything. It took ages to board as people were blocking the aisles. After we settled in, it was a pretty comfortable ride to New York and we arrived early. The IFE has really a lot of content and was more than enough for the journey. The rest of the journey was smooth, except that we had to walk 15 minutes to collect our bags."

Boarding and flight was fine and efficient when it happened - end of the day only a one hour filght (and one hour delay). Despite delay, us and luggage well taken care of. Would fly Delta again."

Process of rescheduling was somewhat stressful. Westjet and Delta staff were helpful but their systems do not interact well. Worked with Westjet gate attendant then followed that with calls to Delta, Westjet and finally Delta again to sort out a flight change for the next day for a Bangor to RDU routing. Flight out of Bangor was delayed. Gate agent at Bangor was greeting passengers as they reached the gate area, offering snacks, pre-checking bags, thanking everyone for flying Delta. He was also proactive in assisting those who needed help with wheelchairs or pre-boarding. Flight BGR-LGA was okay - crew efficient and professional. Connection in LGA went okay, flight to RDU boarded a bit early but pilot came on the PA and sounded very frustrated as he advised us of a last minute route change from Air Traffic Control. This caused a slight delay in take off. Flight was okay as well though very unusual - we flew very low (about 5,000 feet according to Flight Tracker) for most of the route. This made the trip a bit longer than scheduled but the pilot kept us informed so not a big issue. Flight attendants also efficient and professional. Considering the challenges of flying out of the US Northeast due to the Christmas weather, Delta did a very good job."

We really didn't like that we were not able to choose our seats. We had to check in at the airport, using a machine, which allocated our seats. As we were right at the back of the plane, we were not particularly surprised to find that there was no choice left for us when the first meal was served. However, when it happened again on the second meal, I have to say that I was pretty annoyed. They had also completely run out of the icecream and there was no excuse for just not having enough of something that was not a choice. I cannot understand why, having disappointed us the first meal, they could not have served us first on the second meal, the kitchen was directly behind us and they had to pass us to start serving from the front again. We ended up having nothing at all to eat and my husband was ravenous. The meal we had the first time was pretty poor too, I mostly ate the cheese and biscuits."

Delta has failed to get me to my destination in a comfortable and timely fashion every time I have flown with them. The most recent fiasco was my flight from Charlotte to Albuquerque. Less than an hour after taking off, the captain comes over the speaker to tell us that the cabin pressure system had malfunctioned and to remain safe we had to stay at 10k feet and divert to Cincinnati. We were informed that we all had to deplane and was told it would be a few minutes. After a half hour of no information, I finally talked to the customer service. They informed me that it was going to be another hour. The hour passes then it's two hours. Then three. I talk to customer service to see what I could do about missing my connection. I was given 3 options; have a six and a half layover to wait for the next plane, fly back to Charlotte and try again in three days, or give up and get a flight on a more reliable airline. On top of this awful situation, in the past I have been snapped at by customer service, delayed four and a half hours because a kid puked in the aisle, ignored by chatting FA, and left stranded in another country for 18 hours. Do not trust this airline to get you anywhere in a safe or timely manner."

Once at the gate, the flight got pushed out by another hour and eventually we were moved to another gate for departure. Boarding was delayed yet another 30 minutes but was conducted by zone and in an orderly manner. Onboard the seat was comfortable and having purchased an exit row seat, I had ample leg room. The service was prompt and we were offered drinks and a choice of 4 snacks. The FA were efficient but lacked warmth. The flight eventually departed with a 3 hour delay and was late arriving after in Tampa. We were briefed on the nature of delays which were not directly the fault of the airline and most were the result of the supremely inefficient LGA. Overall a pleasant experience for a domestic flight in economy."

So, over the night we had 1 inch of snow in Portland and our flight was scheduled for 6:00AM. We get to the airport and see that the check in supposed to start at 5:20AM starts at 5:40AM.  We get jn the plane, it was already over 6:00AM and people were still finding their seats. I have to mention that our connecting flight in SLC was 30 minutes away from the PDX flight landing. This combo of flights was offered by the company I did not choose it specifically. Temperature outside was about 40 degrees no snowing, no raining and they had to deice the plane. Only that they started doing it at 6:15AM. Again, Our departure was scheduled at 6:00AM they start deicing at 6:15. Great customer service, especially after we got stuck on the tarmac for another hour so our plane ended up taking off at 7:15AM. We missed the connection in SLC. I go to the counter lady who of course told us that she will rebook us the second day. I said fine, so who is gonna cover our hotel and expenses? She said we do not cover that type of stuff when a delay is because of the weather? And here I give up, when you were already late with the boarding you act incompetent and start to deice the plane with 15 minutes after the departure time, when outside is clear sky and 40 degrees? When I brought up all these arguments to her she did not know what excuse to find and she said that she will not cover our expenses and she is the boss so I cannot talk with anybody else. So after showing a huge level of incompetency to your clients that paid for your tickets, you do not even try to make it up to them? Weather related means the weather stopped you from flying in time, not you having some ice on the airplane while the skies are clear since hours ago and you did not take the time to clean it. "

Doesn’t seem likely that this would take 4 hours. Horrible service every single time. No one knows what is going on ever. Haven’t flown with delta for 4 years because of how horrible they are every single time and I don’t intend to ever again. If you want a smooth flight, do not ever take Delta.

We booked our flight the morning of Christmas Eve due to work schedules out of california to sunny Las Vegas. The day before our flight we were so excited to know that next morning we would be spending our Christmas Eve with my family. Unfortunately for us our plans changed quickly for the worst. At 7:30 pm we got a text saying our flight was cancelled, my husbands flight got rebooked to get into Las Vegas late Christmas Eve and my flight wasn’t rebooked to get in Christmas Day. We didn’t panic because we thought we would have enough time to resolve this issue. However we got stuck on hold with Delta for 3.5 hours. By that time we decided this is a joke and if we’re going to beat holiday traffic Christmas Eve we better get going even if that meant we wouldn’t get to our destination until 3:00 am. We were already on vacation so we had to extend our rental another day and pay for gas in an SUV to get to Vegas. By the time we were an hour into our drive delta finally answered only to tell us that our flight was cancelled due to weather and that there was nothing they could do to make this situation right. It’s unfortunate because the weather was perfect out of California and Las Vegas. We will not be relying on Delta to handle our travel plans in the future."

Early am efficient check in at Dublin similar for pre clearance prior to boarding. The lounge after clearance is far superior to the DATA lounges in both T1 & T2 in Dublin. Boarded the rather ageing aircraft with 40 rather cramped seats. Had to ask for a welcome drink, this set the scene for what was to be an underwhelming standard of service throughout the flight. They ran out of the beef entree along with the French red. Champagne was closeted away, the sauce with the chicken was far too salty for my liking. Amenity kit which is touted is very basic does not have a comb, however in its defense it does contain a generic hand sanitizer in gel form however would have been better had this been Purell. Marks out of 10 would be a six plus average in terms of comfort. Service was lackluster and not personable on this six hour flight.

I did appreciate the free IFE, lots of free movies and TV shows to select from as well as plenty of beverages. The flight attendants were attentive for the most part, the pilot kept us updated with weather, any upcoming turbulence, wind speeds and time. The flight was very quiet and smooth. The 2nd leg of my trip trip was on a CRJ900 I was pre-selected for a window exit seat (since i flew basic economy) im glad the flight was only 45 min. because the seating was horrible no recline, very small plane so people would bump into your shoulder in the aisle, I also had to share the same armrest with the passenger next to me, the plane was very old and seemed worn out seat cushions were lifting up and partially torn.

They were efficient and more than polite. The level of concern they showed and their willingness to bend over backwards to accommodate the passengers was incredible. They worked quickly but took time to explain questions asked and not make us feel rushed through. I was traveling alone and not being an experienced traveler, I was extremely nervous. But the young lady really made the inconvenience much less scary and went out of her way to show us step by step what was about to happen.

Onboard, the older FA  had no personality to be a rep for customer service for Delta. She was so rude from the minute we stepped foot onto the plane looking everyone up and down and making faces. While waiting to get to the gate at a complete standstill, while sitting right next to the bathrooms, instead of speaking one on one to us, she made an announcement very rudely as my boyfriend walked into the bathroom that we were holding up the flight. If there is one thing that makes a flight, it is the flight attendants personality, and for her attitude alone, my boyfriend and I will look elsewhere to give our business."

Would not recommend this airline to any person. Terrible customer service when they delayed our flight three times and ended up canceling. We were also told that there would be no flights to our destination in the next two days due to it being already full from earlier cancellations. Not to mention, the hotels nearby were already filled with reservation and they provided the least possible amount of customer service in a very rude along with unprofessional manner. Our former flight before our connecting flight was also a disaster to say the least. Never have I ever landed at the destination only to wait an hour just to get off the plane. Why? This was all due to Delta's poor planning of available gates for incoming planes. When we did get to the gate, we had to wait for their crew to actually do their job for once for us to actually enter the airport. That was an additionally ten minute delay. Absolutely terrible communication between their workers. Delta, get your act together and actually prioritize your customers."

The entertainment is very good, the food is okay, and the legroom is usually pretty good. On this flight we got upgraded to Delta Comfort, I usually fly economy. Our flight from Seattle to Beijing was smooth, and comfortable. I highly recommend Delta Comfort, the extra legroom and recline really does make a great difference. Delta does do its best to satisfy customers, and those who gave Delta a bad review, I have to say that everyone had bad experiences, but in order to judge a airline, you have to have at least flown them 3 times in recent years (0-2 years ago)."

Myself and my wife, our son, his wife and three grand children aged 5, 4 and 2. Delta changed the flight schedule five times after the original booking including one with a suggested connection arrival time into Detroit after the flight to Amsterdam had actually left! I have never know so many changes to occur on what appeared to be a frequent basis! My issue however is with seat allocation and the way that Delta change it! On the flight from Orlando to Atlanta (A321) we had selected two rows of three seats one behind the other (the infant was not allocated a seat). Delta split this into 2x2 and 2x1 seats with the four and five year olds being allocated seats on their own. Madness! On the next flight from Atlanta to Amsterdam (A330) we had reserved a block of 4 seats in the central aisle of row 37 with two seats behind in row 38. Delta then changed this to the four in row 37 and two in row 31 so that (in their words) ""we could all be together""! Again the family were split up for no apparent reason! Do Delta have a vendetta against families sitting together? The food on this leg was also the worst that I have ever encountered on an international flight. Tasteless and inedible. It seemed to comprise random bits thrown together. The flights were cheap but so was everything else!"

Boarding was at 11:20am. I got there at 11:35am as the security line was pretty long. When I boarded the plane it looked almost full. The only thing I had with me was 1 carry on. I could not find space in the first class section, so I walked down to about the 15th row of seats and could not find a space for it all. I decided to go backup to the front and let the flight attendant know about my situation. The line of the passengers behind me was building up as they were boarding the plane trying to get to their seats while I was trying to get back to the front. The flight attendant saw me and noticed that I was trying to get back up to the front. I was able to tell her my problem, She gave me the most nasty attitude as if it was my fault that there was no more room on the plane for my carry on. I was in shock - a first class customer struggling with my carry on and here she is acting like if it was my fault! This is the last thing I would expect from a flight attendant under the circumstances I was in. Will never fly with Delta again if there is other options available."

This flight did not last a full hour and I must mention that there is a marked difference between the friendliness of the international crew of Delta and the domestic crew of Delta. The domestic crew are far less professional on their behavior and attitude to passengers onboard. My connecting flight from Italy to New York arrived on time however the bags were placed late on the belt and by the time I made it through US customs and walked from gate 14 to 33 because no one in JFK was willing to help I arrived at the plane seconds before they closed the door. Upon entering the aircraft I was surprised because the flight attendant told me to sit in seat 4 D (Business Class) I thought this was due to the delay as a way of saying thank you I quickly found out she made a mistake and in front of everyone asked me to leave the cabin (I was embarrassed to say the least), realizing what she had done she offered me a ""Comfort Seat"", to be honest I did not notice any difference between that seat and a regular seat on coach. I have to say the aircraft looked brand new, clean and before I could buckle my seatbelt we were already in Philadelphia. Delta’s iPhone app is great for tracking your bags and other flight related info. My only observation is the marked difference between the domestic and the international crew. Overall I would fly Delta again, the planes look and feel new, clean, the seats and space are better than their other US competitors. Good job Delta just please could you retrain your domestic crew to be more like your international crew? I’m still a fan regardless of that!"

I was hoping to get their signature airplane, the new Airbus 350 however the equipment we flew in Airbus 330 was very nice. Upon boarding I asked one of the flight attendants if I could move to an empty row and she was very nice and said to me that I could grab any seat I wished so I went on and sat on an empty row of 2. I have attached multiple pictures to show the menu with the great choices they give you (in coach!), the airplane had Wi-Fi for the entire nine hour flight, however I must mention that the entertainment was not good. The TV shows and the music channels were not working. To be honest that was not a deterrent because I was thrilled with the Wi-Fi and thanks to my T-Mobile plan I had one free hour plus unlimited texting on Messenger and WhatsApp. I usually fly internationally on European or Asian airlines because the service provided by US-based companies is poor however Delta is changing this and they are a strong competitor in this route up to par with European-based airlines, they can’t match the Asian airlines yet but compared to other US companies they provide a superior service and I would fly Delta international again for sure. I must make an observation about Delta’s new ""Comfort Seat"" I’m not sure it’s worth the money because I did not see a difference between that seat and the one I had. I hope they expand to premium economy on more flights. Overall I give Delta two thumbs up!"
1880,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Spokane,November 2017,1,1,,,1,,1,0,✅ Verified Review ,"  I booked Spokane to San Jose, then San Jose to Spokane. This originally consisted of 4 flights. Spokane to Seattle and Seattle to San Jose and vice versa. Only 1 of those flights actually happened. I was notified and hour before my first flight that it had been cancelled and was only offered a flight leaving in the next 30 minutes or a flight leaving 6 hours later than planned. The flights did not go through Seattle either, they went through Salt Lake City. This wasn’t a huge deal. I got to San Jose a little earlier than planned, but not without the headache. On the way back to Spokane, my flight from San Jose to Seattle went accordingly. However on arrival to SeaTac airport, I was informed of a delay. I was also told that I would be leaving from gate D4. I went to D4 and the screen said Eugene Oregon. So, I updated my email and it said I was actually to leave from S16. I went to gate S16. There was nothing. I asked the concierge desk and they said flight from D4 had left. So I switched to the next flight to Spokane. Which was only a stand-by ticket. I figured since I had an hour, I’d check if D4 had actually left. It had not. They would not switch me back to my original flight from D4. I am now 3 hours past my original time of departure waiting to see if I get a spot on the god forsaken plane."
1881,8,Boeing 767,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to New York JFK,October 2017,4,5,5,5,3,4,4,1,✅ Verified Review ,"  Los Angeles to New York JFK. A very pleasant experience with Delta, check-in and bag drop at LAX was seamless, despite long lines for the security at terminal 2. However the boarding process was a bit hectic and it feels like Delta is trying to cram as many flights into the small terminal 2 at LAX. Flight services on the cross-continent flight are wonderful. Glad to see they've upgraded the personal entertainment system on the 767s into newer larger HD screens. It's the best flying across the country on a 767 since it's spacious and you don't have to pass 2 people to go out of your seat if you have a window seat. Really surprised that on this flight delta provided complimentary lunch for all classes (even economy!) The beef pastrami sandwich was so good it made into one of the best pastrami I've ever had! Food was well-plated and presented too, with a side salad and desserts. Delta also now provides free wifi for texting and messaging on all flights! This is a game changer! Big shout out to Delta for bringing back free meals and making flying an enjoyment again!"
1882,5,Boeing 767-400,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Tampa via Atlanta,October 2017,2,3,1,,3,3,3,0,✅ Verified Review ,"  Munich to Tampa via Atlanta. First time I have flown Delta internationally as it is not an airline I typically fly or prefer. But due to an attractive airfare from Germany to Florida in business class I decided to give it a try. I was shocked about the age of the plane and the seating for business class. Both are old and outdated. I read Delta decided to keep its aging aircraft and not turn over for newer aircraft and clearly this route is one of those where the older planes are utilized. Their terminal location at the Munich airport is in keeping with their aircraft, old beat up, primitive and a lot of cattle herding before boarding the aircraft. Once onboard and into my seat I realized the business class seats were really out of date in both design and fittings. The video system failed and was unavailable for the flight which was a real drag for 9.4 hours. The provided headphones were cheap copies of Bose which in other airlines is a standard for business and first class. (Return flight I will be sure to download movies and bring my own headset.) The food service looked good but the chicken meal was so overcooked and the cooked spinach was filled with grit. The light meal served before landing in Atlanta was so salty I could not eat it either. So both meals were inedible and a good thing I had a solid breakfast before boarding the flight. Seat was comfortable but very tight unless one is 150 lbs and under 5'10"". A blanket and good size pillow was provided which helped. Bottled water was provided so one did not have to ring for the flight attendant for something to drink. Because of the configuration of the 767 the bathroom was behind business class and attached next to the food preparation area for coach passengers. This also meant sharing those bathrooms with coach passengers as well. Though I never had to wait for a free bathroom. Again, old plane with a older design compared to the new standards most airlines now have for their bread and butter business class passengers. OK for the much talked about service model that Delta staff employ for its business class passengers is true they do really try hard to be charming and helpful but I suspect it is to cover up all the Delta deficiencies has using these out of date aircraft. But in the end it did not help the fact the food was terrible, the video system did not work and the airport waiting, boarding process was much akin to a SouthWest experience."

Check in was easy - a more than helpful staff member assisted me. The in flight service was provided by friendly and efficient staff - they seemed to enjoy their job. The aircraft seats were comfortable with adequate (not ample) legroom. The food and beverage service was good. Overall, a pleasant change from other full service carriers.

Delta was very generous with their in-flight meals and drinks. The IFE screen on the A350-900 was large and very easy to navigate. As I was sitting at the back, the space in the overhead storage area was reduced to accommodate the crew rest area. The Narita-based crew seemed more approachable and friendlier compared to the Detroit-based crew."

We were unable to book a seat without paying for them even on the day of the flight. We were told at check in we would receive seats at the gate but not before and they could not guarantee I would be seated next to my children, it could possibly be in front of or behind but they would not discuss why I didn't have seats. I was travelling with my two children and this was worrying. When we went through security we could not scan our boarding passes and were told by security that we were on standby. This was very upsetting, I had booked the tickets months earlier. Finally on the flight, my son, was in the row in front of me, the first statement the steward made was, ""We are very understaffed and I don't know how we'll cope"". Our return flight with Virgin Airways was wonderful. Everything from seats, 72 hours in advance with no charge, to staff, to check in and all employees were efficient, polite, and very professional. Stay away from Delta!"

This was my first time flying Delta and I was impressed. Delta's Comfort + was the most comfortable I've been on in a long time for the price ($1100). That's at least $300 less then other airlines economy class running the Asia route vs Delta's premium Comfort plus. The staff was nice and accommodating, despite there being some confusion with Incheon crew, I think they were in training or new staff cause they seemed a bit nervous so minus a star there. Flight wise, food was above average in taste with 3 selections, not your mom's home cooking but satisfying. Best of all, the free Starbucks and Bailey's on the house and other drink selection was a fantastic touch. Free messaging wifi helped me kept in contact with those below and organize schedules. (Kakao Talk worked, even though it was not on the list of usable apps, so I think any messaging app is ok as long as you don't send pictures or files you're fine.) Delta also gave free face mask, ear plugs and ear phones. Movie infotainment system selection was great. Leg room was ample my knees didn't touch the back on the person in front at all even at front on a full recline, I'm 5'10"". Seats were plush and soft and my the neck rest didn't feel annoying like some airlines that leave you craning. Would definitely fly again in the future. I hope Delta continues to service the Asia route because someone needs to take out United's long haul dominance and end them already."

The flights within USA were okay, not bad. The transatlantic flights were awful, specifically the Atlanta to Munich leg. I am not a giant, my inseam measures 30 inches. The coach seat was so cramped I could not close my legs together. The aisles were to narrow to walk for exercise. After 9 hours in that seat i was in pain when i reached Munich. On the return trip I was able to get my seat changed to an emergency exit row (all upgrade seats were booked). I will never fly Delta for an international flight again."

Anyone below First class and business class were treated as second class citizens. On the return trip we didn't get a seat when we checked in online. It said that the seat would be assigned at the gate. Which gate? I had no idea, because Delta doesn't bother to put it on the ticket. Anyway, a line started to form as the agent got to the gate. She gave the first person in line a seat, the next person a seat and then the third person in line a seat and told the rest of us to sit down unless we were will to give up our reservation for a voucher. She said ""I need to work on the voucher people first"". I was second in line at that point and I asked ""will you at least call the people who were in line first?"" She said she would take my name; I didn't move. The man right offered to take a later flight, but when he was told it was the next day, he sat down. I ended up getting my seat assignments; I presume because she didn't want me to cause anymore trouble. She kept asking for people to take a $600 voucher to give up their paid reservation. Then they start on the carry on luggage threat. ""if you are in zones 2 or 3, there isn't going to be any room to store your carry on. We'll check your bag for free"" I don't want to check my bag, it takes longer to get out of the airport and my husband's bag has been lost several times. We ended up checking our bags and boy was that a mistake! the fly was short but bumpy. We went to claim our package and saw the 20 guarantee. What a joke! After 20 minutes with no bags I went to the baggage claim help center, which was NO help, they told me to wait another 5 minutes that the bags were still on the plane. the bags didn't come out until over 35 minutes. No such guarantee."

Unfortunately, Delta Airlines did not get my baggage on the flight from Atlanta to Amsterdam. My bags didn't get to me in Moscow until the morning of 24 Sept, 4 days late and the day before we were leaving to return to the USA. I had only the casual clothes on my back, and had to buy clothes to wear during the day Saturday, clothes for a semi-formal affair scheduled for Sat night, and for a Sunday visit to St. Sergius Monastery. Shopping in Moscow is expensive and my XL size in most clothing is difficult to find. In a phone call to Delta Customer Service from Moscow (via satellite phone) I was told to ""buy what i needed and I would be reimbursed. "" Now, Delta is saying that their ""partner"" Aeroflot , the airline we arrived on in Moscow, needs to take care of the claim and will not help. Delta has no intention of handling the case or reimbursing me, even though the baggage screw-up occurred on their flight in Atlanta."

I flew with Delta last week, they separated our seats at last second and delayed our flight while on the plane. After sitting in the tarmac for 2 hours we finally took off. I got upgraded, which was basically the same as economy and my boyfriends economy seat had maybe 8 inches of leg room. This week we made the mistake of using basic economy which really means only middle seats in the back of the plane. Had we known that we would have picked a different option. My boyfriend can’t fit in a middle seat, and he isn’t even that big (6 ft, 190 lbs). We call Delta 1.5 hour hold times. Get to the gate and the staff is rude, which always seems to be the case with them. Why are their employees so unhappy? It rubs off on the customers. I fly at least monthly, Delta is always my last choice."

Could have done more to compensate me after a four hour delay in Fargo due to a flat tire. Had to stay in Minneapolis and got to my hotel late. No meal voucher offered. All of my children and grandchildren traveled to visit me for my 65th Birthday. The celebration was delayed because of the flight delay. I asked you if I could get upgraded to first class the next day on my connecting flight due to all of the problems, missing my 65th Birthday celebration and I was told no. Instead I was offered a 200 dollar voucher or 10000 miles. Very poor offer with all that happened and making my 65th Birthday a miserable day. After all of the flights I have taken on Delta this year it makes me wonder if I am a valuable customer. I am a Vice President for a hotel company and had a guest presented these circumstances to one of my hotels, I would have treated that guest like royalty and given him the best room along with meals and even the next stay on us. Overall I am very upset. With all of the poor publicity that airlines are receiving for being apethetic towards their customers, I thought your company would have treated me with empathy and value my business. Instead all I did was continue to hear “ no, there is nothing more we can do”. Very disappointed. "

The smooth proces of checking in and breezing through security and immigration shows the advantage of a quite small airport as Brussels, in comparison to my home airport AMS. Only disadvantage: poor lounge. Delta uses the BA lounge, which has very limited F&B options. Dissapointing. But the onboard experience was very good. The FA working in my area (seat 1A), as well the purser of the flight was very friendly. The other two FA's in C were very kind as well and we had long conversations. F&B: outstanding. The only con was the IFE. A bit limited in content and the overpriced WiFi wasn't worth it for me to give it a try."

On October 15, my husband, our two dogs (weighing 60lbs and 50lbs, respectively) and I boarded Delta flight 674 from St. Thomas. We were stressed: having just been through 2 category 5 hurricanes, the loss of both our jobs and relocating to the mainland, we had little in our emotional reserves as we attempted to settle into our seats. Our flight attendant immediately welcomed us and gave special attention to our heavily sedated dogs. Tina listened to our story and made us feel like the only passengers aboard the full aircraft. I witnessed her executing her duties throughout the flight in a professional, timely and warm manner, and being a lifetime service industry professional, myself, I noted how she engaged her passengers with genuine courtesy. The mark of a true professional is evident when things are going less than perfect, however, and she handled a potentially unpleasant situation with grace and expediency. We are now lifelong customers and will continue to recommend Delta to all our friends and family."

I would fine if she answered me with “you can only pick one”. Very rude. Will Delta go bankrupt over a cookie and a pretzel that she had to make a big deal about me wanting both?

All flights were on CRJ-900 regional jets. Flights left and arrived on time. Crews generally pleasant and efficient. Pilot on the first flight (RDU-BOS) came into the cabin before departure to introduce himself and the crew and provide flight info - a nice touch. Seating tight but tolerable for a short flight. Planes in decent shape and reasonably clean. Delta had changed my routing after I purchased the tickets which was not an issue for me as the timing was essentially the same. However, they did not send an advisory on this but, fortunately, I double check reservations a couple of time before I travel so I caught the change. I did print out all my copies of the schedule to be on the safe side and this turned out to be useful. When we arrived in Toronto on the return leg, the computer system did not seem to recognize the revised booking. When we could not get our boarding passes and the agent questioned our booking, I had the documentation and, though it took about 15-20 minutes, she finally got us sorted out and printed our boarding passes. Of course, they did not work when we went to board our flight but the gate agent saw the correction and got us sorted out quickly. Everyone who worked on the issue was helpful which kept our stress levels (relatively) low."

New York JFK to Los Angeles in Delta One is superb even on the 757 which is not quite as grand as the 767. Food, seats, entertainment and service are as good as it gets, JetBlue Mint is tops and this is right up there. Amazing flight attendants. LAX to Kona. Big downgrade, especially in seats. Barely first class qualified. Flight attendants have nothing to work with and do an amazing job in tight quarters with really mediocre food offerings.

Delta allows you to book a flight for a certain day and time and will then change your itinerary by 6hours weeks to months later, with no remediation if their new flight plan for you doesn't work with all the travel plans you've made. Secondly, they routinely check all rollerboards for zone 3 passengers no matter that there are always plenty of overhead spaces. They just don't care that passengers might prefer to keep their possessions with them (which I do, having had checked luggage not arrive with me more times than I can count). Thirdly, seats are very uncomfortable, forcing everyone into a hunched position. One positive is that the last couple planes I've been on have had more leg room and wider aisles than I'm used to. In summary, hate that airlines take advantage of customers. Unfortunately, Delta isn't the only one that does this."

It begins with the cockpit crew and attendants greeting passengers on entrance to and departure from the flights. They seemed more personable and enthusiastic than is common, and communicated pride and pleasure in their work. The food was surprisingly good and plentiful, free beverages were varied and frequent. We counted two passes with hot towels and four involving beverages. The entertainment options were fresh and divergent.Finally, we were forced to return due to a member of family's medical emergency. Delta could not have been more supportive and considerate related to this circumstance. Delta has announced in this past week, the upcoming utilization of a system involving in flight wifi free of charges will be initiated in the near future."

I know complaining about small planes is played out but in this case I went out of my way to purchase specific luggage that meets all airline requirements and of course none of the provided storage space was as advertised. And to top it off the flight was delayed, again. Honestly would travel any other airline if possible. This has to be one of the shorter flights in the country and still service is poor."

It would've been the perfect vacation / honeymoon for me and my husband who got married a week before. Delta gave me the worst traveling experience ever. I bought a total of 16 tickets in the span of 2 weeks for me and my family.  I just want to sit next to my husband. I paid to achieve that. I reserved seats 32A and 32B, but when we went to check in, we got seats 35A and 34B.  I paid for a service and didn't get it. I was traveling with my mom and aunt as well as my husband, but because they left half way, I thought I just booked the seats and would've figured out seating arrangements amongst ourselves when we got on the plane. I realized that even though I reserved seats, I didn't get them. Who separates the newlyweds? You can count on Delta!"

They overbooked the flight to include my ticket, leaving me stranded at Hartsfield since it was the last flight out back to RSW, and said that I would have to find another flight. Waited at the gate kiosk for 15 minutes only to have them rudely direct me to a delta customer service counter. There, I had to wait for almost an hour and once I talked to the lady she said that since I was an economy customer she could not rebook me for another flight since I had a zero balance available. It was their fault they overbooked and they refused to give service. They said I could try calling the customer service number to order another full price ticket (for $458). Found a way better deal with Southwest for $230 that left at a better time."

Delta had a 3x3x3 layout in economy class on this Boeing 777 on this flight from LA to Sydney. I had an economy comfort seat, which features more legroom and slightly more recline, both valuable assets on a 14 hours flight. The seat was comfortable, and I could catch some sleep. The service was decent. However, the food was rather sub-standard. I had a tasteless cheese ravioli dish. At least, I cannot complain regarding the amount of food available: Delta served a snack in the middle of the flight (sandwich, apple, cookie) and breakfast (French toast). Furthermore, they had a snack bar where you could serve yourself during the flight."

At the gate i was informed by the agent the flight is overbooked and if I do decide to go on a later flight I will be awarded with an $800 voucher since it was not to late and sounds great so I said yes I'm in, then she took my boarding pass she copied and told me to go ahead and have a she'll call. I was very hungry but I waited till everyone board which was over an hr of course, later she called my name then she gave me a new boarding pass she said go in, like I had no choice. So I get on the plane, after takeoff I grabbed my book and found my original boarding pass with a seat that the attendant just gave a free earpiece to, and I was just charged for one. I realized she had given my seat away to someone else and give me a broken seat. When I point it out to the flight attendant she said there's nothing they can do for me that the flight is full (with empty first class seats of course) however she will send a red code to the counter at the exit, and go talk to an agent when landed which I did - at the counter in FLL she completely ignored me. She had told me to call if I have a complaint she's busy. "

This service before the boarding was by far the worst experience in a long time. Online Check In didn't work due to technical issues, no seats available at check in to sit next to each other. Even three hours before. Exit was available but didn't give us without charge. No customer service as I expect. Was supposed to ask at gate, waited 20 Min and the answer was ""No, flight full.

Further, despite being very approachable they maintained a highly professional approach. In respect of the food, there was a good range on the menu and the ""hot food"" was actually hot. The only small downside re refreshments was that we were not provided with the usual pre-flight drink on our way back from Portland. Seating and in flight entertainment were fine though I did not find the flatbed particularly comfortable.

Delta uses a narrow-body Boeing 757-200 for this flight, which features the same business class as in domestic flights. It has five rows with 2x2 recliner seats. But for a four-hour flight, this is perfectly sufficient. The service was very good, and the food was tasty. Delta usually has a meat and a vegetarian option on this flight. I had a salad, Ravioli with fresh vegetables and a fruit platter for desert. I could not have asked for more."

We had very good customer service on our recent trip to Tampa! I was worried about traveling in light of the negative publicity surrounding different airlines, especially traveling with a 5 year old, a 2 year old and infant. Allowing us to board first and get settled was very helpful as well as allowing us to check car seats, strollers at no cost. But the best part was when we were coming back and my 2year old grandson had had enough refusing to buckle, wanting to get out of his seat, etc. We were in the very back seat next to the stewardesses seat. A lady sat beside him and held his hand and talked with him, got him cookies and juice, showed him pictures of her children while we were taking off and landing. She was so good and sweet with him!

Shuttled across the airport and boarded to find that we were delayed because they had to verify the switch (due to a faulty turbo needed for Alaska but not Los Angeles) and because we had too much fuel (again, needed for Alaska not LA). Then because during the now 90 min wait with no air conditioning on a 85+ degree day* we'd used gas from one side of the plane and not the other so it had to be siphoned over. Amazing crew of flight attendants gave us water for the heat and encouraged us to file official complaints. But that 1/2 glass of ice-less water each used up the entire flight's supply. Lots of unhappy flyers, crew, and missed connections."

Could Delta be as bad as everyone I knew told me it was. I should have trusted my instinct. A clapped out old A330, clapped out cabin design, the seat to be fair was comfortable and I did get a good sleep. Dinner service did not happen as they did not have enough beef to cater for the needs of their business passengers. Sat in seat 4J I was surprised to learn that you need to sit on the ""captains side"" of the plane if you want to get your choice of meal with Delta. The crew member I spoke to was wholly disinterested in any form of complaint and said ""Listen what do you want?"" Naturally I considered approaching the purser on the plane to speak to him about perhaps guiding his staff on how to deal with premium passengers. When I learned a few moments later that this guy was the purser I realised that my night was over and this was a bus service to Atlanta and that I should expect no level of service whatsoever. Looking for good things. The seat, thats it. Bring your own food, don't expect any manners, get on the bus, sit down, shut up and you'll get to your destination in one piece. I spend a lot of my own money flying in a style that I like to enjoy. Delta failed, failed and failed again. I regret that I now have to continue flying on to Paris with Delta. Thankfully this flight is in economy and as such I already have no expectation of service whatsoever."

During the flight, he and a stewardess went over and above to make my grandson (age 7) and I have a delightful trip. The plane was beautiful- very clean and well maintained.

The Delta First Class seat looks like a 1990s long-haul business class seat, with the difference it does not recline and there is no footrest. Food selection very limited (sandwich or chicken salad), I took the salad and quality was overall good; beverages selection limited as well and a Chardonnay served in a plastic glass before take.off is something simply meaningless (especially if during dinner proper glasses are used). Crew - like in the previous long-haul flight - seemed a bit too ""casual"", which can be easily misunderstood with unprofessional (I have been more than once addressed as ""honey"" during the flight). IFE very good on such a short flight, with large screen and possibility to use my own headphones. Overall an average experience."
1931,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Killeen,May 2017,,,,,1,,1,0,✅ Verified Review ,"  My son is in the military in Killeen Tx, he has a four day weekend coming up and wants to come visit. I purchased his tickets from Killeen to Panama City (United) for August 31 and the return trip on Delta for September 4th. Unfortunately Harvey happened and United had to cancel his outgoing flight to Panama City. I called JustFly (the online ticketing agency) and Delta to request a refund for the return trip due to the fact that my son will not be in Florida due to the cancelled flight (if he is not in Florida, he cannot utilize a flight from Florida). Justfly said they needed some sort of waiver from Delta to process a cancellation and refund, Delta said that the flight was not affected by Harvey and therefore there will be no refund. My son only had that 4 day available to come visit, yet Delta was very proud that they were willing to waive the change fee, and were gracious to give me a credit that could be used anytime before August 2018. I told them that the only reason I had to cancel the flight was because my son will not be in Florida, it only makes sense that if he is not here he cannot board a plane here. I was also informed that if I did not call Delta back on September 4th to cancel his reservation I would be charged a no show fee (funny how me being on the phone (with both Delta and Justfly for a total of 4hrs, did not qualify as notice that he would not be on the return trip, of a trip he cannot take!). I can see having an issue if someone was just willy nilly changing their minds about traveling, sure charge me a change fee, but when you are physically unable to take a trip due to circumstances beyond your control (Harvey has closed down Texas), then the airline should consider the circumstances and provide a refund and cancellation without fees or penalties in hopes that the traveller would remember how gracious the airline had been and would make sure to fly that airline in the future. Unfortunately Delta is not that type of provider, so if you are reading this review I suggest that maybe you shop elsewhere just in case (god forbid) a similar situation happens and you are stuck not able to get your money back. I am sure that Delta will be enjoying a very nice self appreciation party on my dime. No compassion or empathy for their customers."

Quite an awful experience on a decrepit Boeing 767-300. Cabin configuration with a staggered 1-2-1, seat itself very old but sort of ok (narrow though). The worst of this flight is the inflight service, seems at Delta they don't take their premium customers seriously; food below par (entree cold, beef fillet hard as a stone); presentation so poor (when you put some warm bread on my tray, why on Earth should you put it on the butter so that it melts everywhere?). Cabin crew attitude too casual for a business class cabin. IFE in such a small screen that some smartphones are bigger; new business class blanket (by Westin) is oddly covered - on the supposedly external face in a very hard and ""plastic""-look-and-touch material which I fail to understand. Overall the service looks more like a Premium Economy than a Business Class, I keep asking myself when Delta will get rid of those old dinosaurs that are B767s"

Got notification while in the air (we weren't able to receive it until we landed) that our 9.15 flight had been delayed until 2.30. Found out that it was because of a computer glitch that sent crew to other places and it would take that long to get them back. Changed to another flight but that flight was delayed for the same reason. Clerk said this is not the first time this has happened, you should have been here Saturday!

The staff was nice, but our pilot was 2 hours late. A one and a half hour flight turned into 6 hours due to a pilot and the weather. Before returning home I got a alert that my flight was cancelled and that I needed to call Delta. There was a 3 hr wait time.  When I called again later, I waited another hour before finally speaking with someone. She stated there were no flights leaving LGA for the rest of the week, and I find that hard to believe. She stated the only flight leaving LGA was at 6 am the very next morning and  there was a possibility that the flight may not even take off due to weather conditions. I asked if I could have credit for a train or a bus at a later time. I understand that tickets are non refundable, but in the situation, I needed an alternative option.

Great selection of movies, TV shows, games and music. Slept for most of the trip but woke for the landing service. Had beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes. Delicious! They also had laksa noodles which smelled good as well. Bathrooms clean and I like the blue LED mood lighting inside. Way to go Delta! The best international service from a US carrier so far."

In both directions, YYJ-SEA legs were served by SkyWest using CRJ-700 aircraft; SEA-ATL legs used B757 outbound and A321 for the return; ATL-DCA legs used A321s in both directions. For all legs, interior cabins were clean and modern (even the B757, a model that Boeing stopped manufacturing in 2003). A321s were brand-new, but nevertheless had the seating design problem of wasting several centimetres of available fuselage width owing to an unnecessary gap between the window-seat armrests and fuselage. A321s also had the new narrower washroom design. A pregnant or significantly overweight passenger would have difficulty turning around inside. Delta categorizes its passengers under many rubrics – Comfort Class, Comfort+ Class, Delta One Class, SkyPriority Class, Medallion Class, Premium Cabin, Main Cabin, and so on. The only clearly-named category I recognised was ""First Class"". I didn't think any of my flights had a ""First Class"", but, on one of my outbound flights, the gate agents nevertheless announced it as one of the groups for early boarding (even in advance of parents with small children and passengers using wheelchairs!). By the end of my trip, I discovered that my ""Comfort+ Class"" ticket was considered also to be in the ""Premium Cabin"" and ""SkyPriority Class"" categories, which all overlapped. A full set of definitions should have been provided as part of the ticket. IFE offered a decent selection of audio and video, but the categorisation made no sense: better to look for the full A-Z listing. For Comfort+ class, ""snacks"" were offered; but the only real food was a banana. Alcoholic beverages were supposed to be available without additional charge for Comfort+ passengers, but at no time did the FAs explicitly say so. Outbound, the ATL-DCA leg was cancelled, as were three other Delta flights that evening serving the same route. Delta apologised profusely, explaining that thunderstorms in the US northeast corridor had prevented flights from landing at DCA and mentioning air-traffic-control congestion as a contributing factor. Oddly, after I arrived in Washington the next day, friends told me they could recall no rain or thunderstorms in Washington the night before. Passengers on the cancelled flights were required to stay overnight at ATL at our own expense. Many passengers did their own rebooking of flights online. Only one Delta agent was present at the service counter near the gate to do rebooking in person. Nearby were Delta telephones where rebooking agents could be reached, but few people noticed them. For overnight lodging, Delta gave us a print-out saying that it had a ""negotiated rate"" with a nearby motor hotel, although it didn't make an outright recommendation. It was a seedy place, well worn and with visible damage to walls and fixtures. It is unwise for Delta to associate its name with that motor hotel. I had one G&T on the ATL-SEA return leg. The FA had no idea how the drink should be poured, even though I'd done my best to ask her to (i) give me a cup with a couple of ice cubes, then (ii) give me the little bottle of gin (they offered Bombay Sapphire), and then (iii) let me pour the tonic water as the last step. She kept giving me a combination of ice and tonic water first, for me to add the gin as the last step. My Grandma would be horrified."

Then when I check in 24 hrs in advance, they again will not give me an option to select a seat? Then, I have to go to the counter to get a seat even assigned to me. Then, when I request an isle or a window I am told (with a sarcastic laugh) no due to it being an oversold flight? How again an oversold flight is my problem? I followed protocol and I get punished as a customer. I tried Delta again after a while of not using them due to similar issues, but I am sorry to say it's back to American Airlines for me. I'm sure Delta will never read this and even if they do they won't care, I'm just trying to protect fellow passengers who spend their hard earned money on this ridiculous company.

It was just a small amount they gave us back but we thought it's worth it to use it. But after what happened to us on august 2 we will never book with delta again. Our plane was scheduled for 7:02 pm (August 2nd) but then they kept delaying the flight for 3 hours and it kept getting more. Around 8 we saw that other flights would depart earlier then ours (by that time 12:30) so we tried to check if there were other seats available on other planes ! That was the time when we read that the flight got cancelled! We did not get informed by delta nothing! It was not even on the board. So we went to the gate agent to talk with them but the people we talked to didn't understand our situation at all.  We literally had to beg them to help us. My boyfriend called the number they gave us to at least get a coupon or anything that could help us out. But nothing. Even when I asked them for blankets they got mad. Just because we didn't want to accept that they are allowed to treat us like that just because the flight got canceled due bad weather conditions in New York.  Now was the time we gave up hope and decided to stay next to other people sleeping on the Floor waiting for our flight to depart at 11:10 am! Which means we spent more than 16hours at the airport waiting to fly to Atlanta before we finally got the chance to fly back to New York. In Miami we ended up sleeping on a bench. But the benches there are the hardest I ever sat on so it was pretty much impossible to sleep. I swear that was the first and definitely the last time in my life I fly with delta.

Delta decides to delay a plane with approximately 25 people for 3 hours because ""a flight attendant got lost"". So needless to say, my son missed his first connection, now will miss the second connection (and last flight to Florida by the way) and now has to stay at the airport until the next flight after 8am tomorrow.

I am a Diamond Medallion, almost 2 million mile flyer. I have flown Delta forever and stand behind the company as (generally) nearly world-class. On this trip I really needed some help, asked for it, and was ignored by Delta. I flew FLL-ATL-AMS, travelling in Delta One and First Class, connecting in AMS to KLM for onward travel. I bought the flight on Delta.Com and despite have a 1:04 connection time in ATL did not see the timing as a problem. Bad weather in ATL delayed us and, oddly, FLL agents boarded the flight, then unboarded, then immediately reboarded the airplane. While in the terminal waiting to reboard I asked a Redcoat to notify ATL of my close connection and asked for “meet and assist” help upon arrival. I watched him type in the request and listened as he read it to me. We arrived in ATL on an A gate with 24 minutes to spare – my AMS departure was leaving from an E gate. Of course, no one was there to assist and the one gate agent had his hands full with normal gate arrival activities. While running to the connections train I saw on a departures board that the AMS flight, which had been showing on-time on the Delta mobile app, was now delayed 30 minutes. Not sure what to believe I hustled to the E gate, where boarding had not even begun. I am disappointed because on this trip I needed help from Delta and got blown off. As a passenger asking for help I hoped they would step up. I am hugely disappointed in their lack of response. Apparently loyalty is one–way only."

Have no idea if luggage made it or not and freezing cold lying on floor amongst all the dust and construction noise. Very unpleasant situation.

The service workers are as good as they can be but the policy makers have put all these folks in a bad spot cramming tons of people in tight spaces. Boarding and exiting the plane is unorganized and difficult. Delta are a bad choice if your flight is over 90 minutes long. Leg room is non-existent, even in most of their preferred seating. Long lines in just two bathrooms areas from NYC to San Francisco. Will not be flying Delta anymore."

My flight has been delayed until August 6th 12h00 pm. The aircraft had a mechanical problem which would be supposed to be fix up during the night. Because I was in transit, I didn't havethe right to go out of the airport to the hotel that was offered by the airline. I was the only customer in this situation, so they managed my problem by giving me a mattress, a pillow and a blanket, and told me to sleep in the airport. I asked if it would be possible to open one of the Delta Lounge for the night, but I was told that it was not possible. I waited 1 hour and a half for the pillow and the blanket. One of the passenger told me that that it was the second cancellation in 2 days for this flight going to Montreal. "
1949,2,A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Boston to Vienna via Amsterdam,June 2017,3,1,,,1,,2,0,✅ Verified Review ,"  Originally supposed to fly Boston to Vienna via Amsterdam. I arrived at terminal A at the airport in Boston at 13.00 for the 16.45 flight. Check-in took longer than it should. I then went to the Delta skyclub lounge and it was dirty. The food was mediocre. You also have to ask an employee for the wifi password. I went to the gate and the flight started boarding at the normal time. Seats were not the most comfortable, even for business class. A crew member rudely forced me to put my passport in the overhead bin rather than in front of me. I never forget stuff on aircrafts! We were just about to depart when the captain told us there was a delay because of a broken air vent in the cockpit that was just discovered. The plane was sitting at that gate all day. Why didn’t they spot the damage when the plane arrived from Amsterdam that morning? First the crew spent 25 minutes trying to fix the vent in the hot sun with no air conditioning allowed, then another 30 minutes talking on the phone with their maintenance HQ, then they told us there would be a delay until 20.30 at night. We were forced to exit the aircraft so they could take it to the hangar. Now we had 300 people with missed connections waiting in line at the help desk with only 2 employees there. The staff acted uncaring and oblivious and many people were getting very angry with them. When I reached the front of the line the Delta customer service staff told me I couldn’t do anything and I was forced to stay on this delayed flight. They didn’t even look at other options! I did not see them look down at their computer screens when I asked them about re-booking. They probably just want my money. They never updated us on the repair progress but the flight was now delayed until 23.00. At that point I wouldn’t make it back to Austria for another 2 days. I called my travel agent and they successfully rebooked me on a 22.15 Lufthansa flight through Frankfurt. It was on time and everything about that airline (lounge and aircraft) was so much better than Delta! I arrived in Vienna 5 hours later than expected. I later found out the Delta flight to Amsterdam was eventually cancelled. Avoid this airline for international connections!"
1950,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Spokane,July 2017,1,1,,,1,1,1,0,✅ Verified Review ,"  My flight was supposed to be such a short trip, that is why I chose to fly instead of drive from Seattle to Spokane. Both flights were majorly delayed on my trip and it defeated the purpose of flying. In addition to that, it seemed very prominent with the crew that this is a regular thing. When I go onto the plane, the overhead bins barely fit my carry on purse. I had to fly with my carry on underneath my feet. With all the delay and keeping us at the airport so long, you think they would at least hand out pretzels or water. Nope. Terrible schedule and service. I will never be flying Delta again. Should have flown Alaska. They had a Spokane to Seattle flight scheduled for later than mine - that arrived in Seatac before my Delta flight did."
1951,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Los Angeles,July 2017,1,4,2,2,1,2,2,0,✅ Verified Review ," I missed my connecting flight with Delta due to an electrical storm. Although that is not the airline's fault, the fact that I had less than 5 minutes to get to my other plane and the crew did not ask for people who were not connecting to wait to disembark so those of us that needed to run could make our connections. Atlanta is a big airport and of course the connecting plane was on the opposite side of the terminal. Once making it to the connecting gate, the customer service representative chuckled when she told the 4 people, that needed that plane, ""yes, that's your plane pulling away"". I slept in the terminal because the next available flight was 9 hours later. Gate changed at least 3 times. I am writing this as I sit on the plane they rebooked me on, supposedly getting ready to go, but actually has sat at the gate with all passengers for over an hour because the underground fuel tanks aren't working. Needless to say, my connecting flight has now been delayed by 1.5 hours. My main complaints are that the desk people are rude and the communication is poor. The airport is dirty."

Both my flights (BOS-LGA delayed from 7pm to 8:30pm and LGA-CHO delayed from 9 pm to 11 pm) were delayed by couple of hours which was fine and understood - but just 30 mins before my 2nd flight (at 8:30 for LGA-CHO) they emailed me that the 2nd leg of the flight will be on time and the first flight won't reach on time for me to even think about rushing and getting to gate to try to make it. Cherry on the cake they did not even wait for few passengers going to CHO and said you are scheduled for next afternoon now via Atlanta - so basically by the time I reach my final destination it will be 7pm of next day. By the way, no apologies at all during the whole 24 hrs process. Will never fly Delta!"

When I arrived late to make my connecting flight the gate attendent told me there was no room. Gave us a $100.00 voucher and said they would supply us with pillows and blankets. We were apparently welcome to sleep anywhere in the airport. $100.00 is compensation really? Apparently if look around there are flat benches. All good works of the flight crew destroyed.

Only 3, sometimes 4 staff were around to take care of a long line. When I checked in I found that there was no seat for me. The excuse being that there was a change of equipment. However since there was a 21 D on this plane what difference is that? I was offerred the back row in exchange, no regret, not sorry, so nothing. Then I was told by this astonshing gate man that If I was nice he would not lose interest in helping me. Is this behaviour going to be allowed go forward?"

Complaints sent to Delta for reference to anybody misguided enough to think of flying with them. 3 flights on delta in 3 days, each flight significantly delayed, due to incompetence at a level I have never experienced before, including over an hour to load freight that arrived late, and gate staff posting an hour delay resulting in passengers leaving the gate then scrambling to get them back to the gate. Three flights overbooked, incredible. And to add insult to an already desperately bad service the cabin staff closed one of the two business toilets twice, once after service and once just before landing for ""staff use"" and I was told to either wait 5 minutes because staff have priority or join a growing queue of paying passengers. I will attempt to never fly Delta again."

I had to spend the night and the day there sleeping on the floor next to the exit of the airport cause they won't let you enter to the gate. I arrived to San Francisco I waited 1 hour to collect my baggage and I found out that they only sent one - the other one is hanging out in New York.

Flight DL446 was scheduled at 9PM July 13, ended up departing 11:13AM the next day. It was delayed hour after hour, first notification of delay was at around 6:30PM that it was delayed to 10:05PM, then 5 minutes later told it is delayed to 11:15PM, then 12:15AM, 1:02, 1:32, 1:50, 2:30 and finally 7AM (this delay was announced at 2:20AM). I decided to cancel and refund my ticket at 2:30AM and just leave as I was going to Reykjavik for the weekend and it would have been a waste. Thankfully the Delta hotline accepted the refund and told I was to receive my money in one week (we'll see how that goes) and that I had to go to baggage service desk in JFK to claim my bag. I filed a baggage request form and was told that it will be delivered to my house in Manhattan by 3:30PM and that the baggage employees arrive at 5:40AM (I had to wait 2.5hrs at least). I had already been at the airport for 8 hours so did not want to wait. Well, now I regret it. Bag never left the plane and boarded the flight to Reykjavik. Not sure how that happened. On July 14, hotline employee told me that it will board the next flight (DL246 KEF-JFK on July 15). I said no problem and did not mind the wait, and I handled this all calmly even though almost all my belongings are in that bag as I am in NY for a few weeks only. I call again today (July 15) and the bag is still in Reykjavik and employee is not sure when it will come back to NY. Honestly I do not mind waiting but to be promised to receive the bag on a day and then for it not to happen not once, but twice, is very poor customer service. After 8 hours in the airport and cancelling my trip, not having my bag with me is the last thing I would want to happen. Also, every single time I called them (at least 6 times so far), I waited at least 20 to 25 minutes on hold before someone picked up."

Really really horrible customer service at their own hub airport in Atlanta. Flight delayed due to their maintenance issue, connection missed and they treat you like you're some annoying homeless person and at first tell you to go to 5 different places, then when you're at the right place, you are not allowed to ask a question without standing first in line for 4 hours (yes 4 hours starting at 12 am) when you get to the counter you're being told that they won't help you because some system error airline didn't release the ticket and they will wait until 8 am when the airline opens at their airport. You're not getting a hotel because they have none available from their partners! So they expect you to ""hang-around"" for 20 hours after already traveling for long to wait for your flight giving you a 15$ voucher for food! This is the most ridiculous service I've ever experienced. When I summed up the fact that they made me wait in line for 4 hours to tell me they won't help me, they denied ever telling me to stand in the line. Very rude and arrogant staff. Last thing you want to experience on a long journey. Avoid Delta at all costs."

I spent most of my flight standing in the back in case and one of the women talked to me and helped take my mind off of how I was feeling. I am so grateful to those flight attendants.

We got to enjoy a snack and a drink on our flights to Orlando and back home. And the TV screens with games and movies made our flight home even more enjoyable. We are so grateful to Delta for making our first flying experience absolutely perfect, and we look forward to flying with them in the future."

I paid a little extra to go with Delta over typical budget airlines, what a mistake! I flown with a dozen or so airlines over the years, and never have I encountered the level of a incompetence and indifference than from the staff of Delta. Not only did the plane arrive 30 minutes late but the stewardesses for the flight arrived an hour past when the flight was scheduled because they were both on separate flights that were also late somehow. Why would you schedule staff to work on one plane when there still in the air working on other plane? This is ridiculous! And this was on a clear summer day, not a winter blizzard. Also, while trying to exchange my tickets weeks in advance because my travel dates changed they resorted to outright extortion. They said they would it cost me $200 per ticket to exchange them for flights that were selling from their own website for $106 each. When I told them that I could just buy new tickets for almost half the price of exchanging them they then told me that they would void my return ticket even though I wasn't trying to chang the return trip. Delta's service is far worse that even the cheapest of the budget airlines. I will never fly with Delta again."

I will never be flying on Delta Air Lines again. We arrived at the gate to find out our flight from Fort Lauderdale to New York JFK was delayed 2 hours due to air traffic in the Washington area. 2 hours later and there is still too much traffic to fly through Washington so we had to change routes to go around. Great idea if only they had the brains to think of this sooner. Now we are finally on the runway and they just realized that the flight time would be longer due to the new route. Turns out we don't have enough fuel. So back to the gate we go. This has been the worst travel experience of my life. To add to it all they ""ran out"" of headphones. I have already been at this airport/on the plane for 6 hours and we are still at the gate. Will we ever make it to New York? Not sure."

At lunch time, the flight attendant literally threw the food platter on my tray telling me ""that's pasta and that's what's left"". The rest of the crew set a mood of intimidation, unfriendliness and brashness. Not one smile, not one courteous gesture: plain rude. I was very surprised to witness that such service would still exist nowadays: a real horror story. We even requested to talk to the cabin manager to lodge a complaint but Delta does not even have a crew manager on board (or so were we told as they might back up each other). A truly appalling experience."

The flight attendants on this trip flying from Montana to Phoenix via Salt Lake City have been terrible - they are completely rude and have to awareness of how to cater to family travelers. The flight attendants tried to make us check our car seat multiple times even though the manufacturer website clearly shows the seat is airline approved. Also we have a Chico key fit 30 which is one of the most popular car seats sold and I would hope before trying to make us check it unnecessarily they would be up to date on the most commonly approved seats. A child can sit in a lap with no seat so I do not see the issue for what seat is traveled with. After throwing a big fuss over our seat and getting management involved and all the other passengers involved telling them it is approved they finally with disgruntled looks on their faces ""let"" us use the seat as an exception! They acted like they were doing a favor by not having us check the seat when it is clearly approved on the website. I am disgusted to pay for a seat and be treated this way as if they are doing us a courtesy. It is completely ridiculous and needless to say Delta will be our last choice for flying going forward."

We were promptly notified that there was a technical issue with the plane and that there would initially be a 30 minute delay. After 30 minutes we had to deplane. The flight crew was professional and extremely helpful. As soon as we got off the plane they were already distributing snacks, drinks, coloring books for the kids, and also some playing cards. Throughout the ordeal the station attendants were helpful, even when passenger tensions were rising, they remained professional. They even helped some passengers with connecting flights and got them on another flight. After the delay the flight crew were amazing. The pilots got out of the cockpit and addressed everyone face-to-face and apologized for the long delay, which to me showed a high sense of professionalism. The free alcoholic drinks in premium economy were excellent. The snacks were suffice for a short 60 minute flight, just some cookies and pretzels. The seats were highly comfortable and had excellent recline as well. There was no seatback entertainment, however, there were magazines provided. I highly recommend flying on Delta, they know how to treat their customers well."

Actually it was just one member who proceeded on three, yes three occasions to ignore me while giving out drinks. Once for a cup of tea, again passed over when offering a bottle of water twice! I get that they need to stretch across to take the window seat person's tray but no excuse me, nothing! One other thing  was just before boarding it seemed a little chaotic as people were lining up and did not know which line or where it seemed to be going. The staff were waving you here there and everywhere. Perhaps putting large print signs with more concise info would be more helpful. Though the rating is on the low side, I would recommend this airline as my London to New York trip went fine but return one not so much."

Plane landed at 1:12pm, and at 2:10 the baggage was still not listed. Finally, a number of us started asking various employees who would walk by (almost always not a Delta employee but an airport one), and finally someone said ""The board is not correct. Wait for an announcement."" Eventually we were told the bags had been already out on Carousel 4 (and there were dozens of flights from Delta and other carriers, with hundreds if not thousands of people in the whole area). Disgusting, and incredibly unprofessional. We need in the USA to follow Europe and punish airlines when they screw us over."

A Delta employee gives me the gate number but doesn't tell me that the connecting gate was at the other end of the terminal and would take a 10 minute walk! Regardless, I arrive at the gate before 30 mins (it took me maybe 28 minutes) but I was told I couldn't board because the airplane door was closed. I was not offered an apology. To make things worse, I had talked to a Delta employee on my way to the gate and asked them to call the delta employees at the connecting gate and let them know that I am on my way.  That was the last flight to LA of the day, and I had to sleep on the ground because I wasn't offered a hotel. I took another flight the next day, which fortunately was half empty. Other than the terrible customer service, the plane was clean. However, the wifi wasn't working. We got the standard minimal beverages and some peanuts."

Cabin crew were friendly, casual but efficient. I was amazed by the retrofitted cabin design and how bright it was. Overhead bin was massive and a carry-on suitcase could fit sitting on the side of the suitcase instead of flat as they normally do. I appreciated when the crew kindly reminded every passenger to get to their seat as soon as possible and move away from the aisle to speed up the boarding process, since we started boarding a few minutes behind the scheduled boarding time but arrived in Orlando 20min early. The entertainment system was very amazing and it's even better than those on long haul international flights. Big screen and a lot of movies to choose from. Free non-alcoholic beverage and snack is a common practice in US domestics flights. I will choose Delta again."

The special treatment continued on the flight with very friendly flight attendants. The snacks provided on this domestic flight is better than what you get on a premium airline in Australia. I am very impressed with the service from all levels. Keep up the good work Delta. My family and I will definitely fly with Delta again.

Very disappointed in Delta Air Lines  and will be canceling delta credit card. We were delayed multiple times by weather related incident to then be told we would be flying when the plane arrives to then be told the flight was canceld as we waited until 1:30 to be told. Waiting around for nothing when we could have been told earlier and either went home or got a hotel and rebooked. Why wait until 1:30am. No compensation or credit or hotel to stay in nothing. Things happen, but to not be taken care of for nothing is a little absurd. Statistics show that if you stayed at a hotel and had an ok experience you would most likely not stay at that hotel. If you had a bad experience, but the staff took care of and made that experience right you would go back at a much higher rate. If only Delta would have done the smallest thing I would def use them again. I will now try and never use them if I have the chance. Thanks Delta, hello Southwest"

The crew were exceptional. There was a man that needed medical attention in the back of the plane and the crew asked overhead if any nurses or doctors could come back. I am an critical care nurse in Seattle, so both me and my sister (also a nurse in Seattle) went back to help. We spent about 15 minutes back there with the man (who turned out okay), but they took our seat numbers in case he needed any more medical attention. Later on in the flight, a flight attendant came by to take our name, email address and home address so that they could give us each a $100 voucher for our services. I was so touched. Delta was kind enough to not only express their gratitude but to give us a reward. Delta was already one of my favorite airlines because of the quality of the flights as well as the entertainment selection, but now they truly are my favorite airline. "

We boarded an older A330-300, from it's registration number it was one of the old Northwest Airlines aircraft, but the layout of the Business First is the latest Delta product. Delta have an excellent record of their upkeep of their aircraft even if they are very old. The entertainment system worked well but the food was very poor. Again the service was professional and top notch. Arrival in Honolulu was ahead of time and we had a great view of the Big Island and Maui and towards landing we saw beautiful Waikiki."

Flight in Seattle delayed, no reason given, which made us late for final leg of trip out of LA. Although plane to Tucson was still on the ground they would not let us board. The airline provided a hotel room. However, it took over 2 hours to get luggage and to the hotel room despite hotel being less than 2 miles from the airport. Returned the following day to fly to Tucson. Gate agent missing, total chaos, and plane left late.

1981,1,MD-88,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta via Richmond,June 2017,1,1,1,,1,1,1,0,✅ Verified Review ,"  I had a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta and connecting flight from Atlanta to Virginia. ""Due to weather"" we were in the air for an hour on which I got left behind from my connecting flight. I got to the gate at 10.30 and the flight was departing at 10.40 and the plane left early. I was left behind in an airport and city I don't know. I proceeded to the gate where Delta employees were ""helping"" customers, but in reality they weren't. One employee started yelling at a customer for not standing in a single file line. After waiting for almost an hour to see if I could catch another flight to my final destination, I finally got to the counter and the delta employee was rude, not helpful and wasn't listening to my needs. All he offered was a flight the next day at 12.07 pm and told me if I didn't like it I could get on the phone and find an alternative. So I got on the phone with a Delta representative, explained my situation and she wasn't helpful either. I asked to be put on a flight with the partner airline that was leaving that same night and her response was no. After being on the phone for 45 mins all I got was a flight from atl to Norfolk at 7am. I got to Norfolk at 9.05 so had missed my interview and was also one hour and 30 mins from from my destination. I am not pleased at all with the way Delta managed the situation. On top of all that my connecting flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale got delayed by 2 hours and no information was given on why it was delayed. Needless to say I will not recommend or flight with Delta again!"
1982,1,,Business,Economy Class,Kansas City to La Guardia,June 2017,1,2,1,1,1,,1,0,✅ Verified Review ,"  Kansas City to La Guardia. Horrible experience. Delta should definitely invest more of their budget fixing their airplanes. Sunday I traveled with them out of LGA and because of technical issues flight was delayed 3 hours, then the excuse was that the flight was overbooked and eight people had to leave the plane. Finally today after hours of delay because of technical issues, the flight was cancelled with no more flights available until tomorrow."
1983,3,,Business,First Class,Washington to West Palm Beach via Atlanta,June 2017,4,1,4,3,2,3,2,0,✅ Verified Review ,"  Washington to West Palm Beach via Atlanta. Just got off a flight where the flight attendants talked on the intercom almost the whole flight. And the volume was so loud my ears are ringing and I have a pounding headache. Never before have I been on such an annoying flight where you couldn't relax, rest, watch a movie, or read because of the incessant talking on the overhead announcer speaker about nothing. When we got off the plane, the person I was traveling with expressed the same frustration. The flights attendants need to shut up! I would much rather fly Southwest where you can actually enjoy your flight!"
1984,8,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Raleigh-Durham,June 2017,3,5,3,,5,,5,1,✅ Verified Review ,"  Flew Tampa to Raleigh-Durham. Kudos to Delta for going above and beyond. I bought tickets three months in advance for my mother and I to attend my nephew's graduation assuming prices would start to rise after that. To my surprise, fares lowered dramatically a few weeks after my purchase. I had originally purchased ""Main Economy"" tickets, Delta's middle tier in economy. Upon seeing the new lower prices, I called Delta who offered to upgrade us to Delta Comfort+, their top tier in economy which offers more legroom, advance boarding and guaranteed overhead bin space. The ticket price of the upgraded seats was lower than what I had paid for Main Economy and Delta's response was to issue each of us the $49 fare difference in vouchers for future travel (which we will definitely use this year before expiry) even though they were under no obligation to do so. My mother requires wheelchair assistance and this was handled flawlessly on both ends of both flights. Both flights left slightly late but arrived on time on the outbound and early on the return. Outbound seat very uncomfortable, return was fine. We had ""bulkhead"" seats both ways on these regional flights and as there is no wall separating First and Economy we were able to stow belongings under the First seat in front of us avoiding the bulkhead inconvenience of having to stow everything in the overhead. Crew polite, helpful and professional on both flights. On the return crew pilfered First snacks in order to provide my mother with a nut and seed free option. WiFi was provided though I did not attempt to use it so cannot comment on speed. If Delta continues to provide this level of service I will continue to fly with them.

1985,2,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Boston via New York,May 2017,1,1,2,2,1,,1,0,✅ Verified Review ,"  Manchester to Boston via New York. I am disgusted by the way Delta treat their customers. My wife and I booked through Virgin a return flight Manchester to Boston via New York. Besides the flight being cancelled from New York to Boston their staff were non existent. We arrived in New York delayed but with a time that was tight as you have to go through security and immigration. After panicking a little we found the flight was delayed. We set off to the boarding gate. I am disabled and require a mobility scooter to get around so I was waiting patiently for Delta member of staff to check us out as usual. This never happened. To cut a long story short the flight while we sat waiting was delayed four time was coming from two different Airports and then cancelled. We were directed by an announcement that we had to go to a certain area in the airport to ascertain what to do next. We arrived at the named area and there was a queue. After waiting for about thirty minutes a staff member came out and said that we should go to another area. This we did it was a long way to go we reached the area and again a queue - after about thirty minutes we got to the desk. I iterated to the staff member that we had been travelling for over 20 hours and I was very sore. The staff member asked my wife to go around the back to look at the screen. I was unable to and also never asked to. The staff member was showing my wife that we were entitled to a hotel because I was disabled. I find this distasteful as surely anyone delayed due to the airline failings were entitled. Anyway we asked how we should get there and produced a voucher for a taxi. We were then told how to get to the taxi stand. I asked about our bags as my medication was in there. We were told to go to another office which was baggage claim. On arriving there we asked about the bags and we were refused. We went to the taxi stand and tried to find the taxi company asking one of the drivers he was not easy to understand he said it was his taxi. I was put in the back by means of ramps and I only just got in. The taxi driver did not know where the hotel was my wife caught a glimpse of it and showed it to the driver. Arriving at the hotel he wanted another voucher for the return journey next day. We did not have one. We ordered a taxi through the hotel, as I could not go through that again costing $40. Arriving at JFK we proceeded to the gate and guess what another delay. I thought here we go again. At the new take off time an hour delay there was further discussion as to how they would handle my mobility scooter and after one member of staff who seemed to be the group leader refusing to load it as they had not been trained. After a long discussion I was allowed to go to the Aircraft doors and my scooter was taken away. My thoughts were I was never going to see it again. I was directed to a seat,which was difficult to get in due to my disability and then found my wife was seated elsewhere. We arrived at Boston and went to retrieve our cases and found they were not there. My wife thought she spotted them some way from the area and sure enough it was them. We were then told that they had come on an earlier flight. It would of been helpful and customer focused to tell us that in the beginning The return flight was also a nightmare but I am not in mood to go on as it gets me more angry by the thought of it"
1986,10,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Washington to Akron via Detroit,June 2017,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,✅ Verified Review ," I had a family emergency and had to cancel my Washington to Akron via Detroit flight 18 hours prior to take off. I notified Delta customer service of my situation and with no questions asked, they cancelled my flight and awarded me with a full credit. I'm very pleased with Delta and their graciousness towards myself. They gave me one less thing to worry about. I definitely will go out of my way to fly only Delta in the future."
1987,3,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to New York,June 2017,3,1,,,1,,3,0,✅ Verified Review ,  Flew Delta from Chicago to New York. Seats are assigned at the gate. Multiple staff members present at the gate however staff chose to ignore me standing there. At my second attempt to asked whether I could be seated next to my husband the staff member barely made eye contact with me and did not offer to assist with this query. I witness other people's queries being answered rudely. Extremely unprofessional service for an airline. I will not be flying with this company in future.
1988,9,A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Barcelona to Atlanta,June 2017,4,5,5,5,5,,4,1,✅ Verified Review ,  Delta continues to be the best of the American legacy airlines. Check-in at Barcelona was easy and the gentleman who printed our boarding passes and took our baggage was very personable and made us feel very welcome. Business class seating was fine and service was efficient and pleasant. IFE was fine and I was able to watch two current movies during my flight. Food was fine and water and beverages available throughout the flight. Overall the flight was a pleasant experience.
1989,8,Boeing 767-300ER,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris CDG to New York,May 2017,5,5,5,5,4,,4,1,✅ Verified Review ,"  Delta Air Lines flight from Paris to Newark was smooth and pleasant. Efficient boarding, take off on time. Very good food: both meals and ice cream and bottle of water in between. FAs were swift and attentive. IFE with a very broad selection of movies/programs. The only downside was a quite old aircraft with all related issues (loose panels, exposed repaired details, drafts in the cabin), but the seat (economy) was surprisingly comfortable. I think Delta would gain many more credits with a newer fleet on the long range flights. In general very good impression. With 2 points subtracted for the aircraft cabin condition, I definitely recommend Delta for trans-atlantic travel."
1990,2,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Seattle,May 2017,1,3,3,3,1,1,1,0,✅ Verified Review ,"  New York to Seattle. The flight was delayed due to a flight attendant being late from another flight. When many of us passengers who were taking connecting flights voiced our concerns about missing our flights to the flight attendants we were ensured that we would reach or something would be done. We arrived in Seattle at 1050 which was approx 30 minutes later than expecting. Due to my connecting flight being on the complete other side of the huge airport I missed my flight, along with many others. Then I was told that although I was supposed to be on a connecting flight I could still get my bags at SeaTac but of course my bags were already at my final destination. It was absolutely horrible!! I would never fly Delta again."
1991,2,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Austin,May 2017,3,4,3,4,2,,2,0,✅ Verified Review ," Delta continues to employ overbooking. As I was flying out of New York to Austin, I was preparing to board when I watched the harried gate agent begin the begging process for anyone willing to give up their seat on the early flight for a guaranteed seat 10 hours later. We were told after the flight had left that we would receive an email explaining the process for receiving our compensation in ""about 30 minutes."" That was Friday - today is Monday - no email. I would think Delta would learn that bad press is to be avoided - but maybe you are functioning on the premise that any press is good press."
1992,1,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Shannon to Columbus via New York,June 2017,3,5,3,3,1,1,1,0,✅ Verified Review ,"  Shannon to Columbus via New York. My family and I  flew internationally and Delta refused to move us to an earlier connecting flight, despite the fact that we had plenty of time and they told us the earlier flight had plenty of seats.  To make us even more mad, they said ""if it was one of you we could do it, but not for a family."" So, I can only conclude that Delta hates families? Or they're just lazy? I'm mad that I have to sit in the airport for 6 more hours. How is Delta so stupid? Now there are less seats on the later flight to possibly sell, and they just chose to anger five international travelers who have families of their own. Way to simultaneously screw your customers and yourself, Delta. We won't be back. I gave them a 1/10 instead of a 0/10 because the flight crew on our first leg of the trip was great."
1993,10,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fresno to Minneapolis,May 2017,4,5,5,,5,,5,1,✅ Verified Review ," I can't express how wonderfully Delta has treated me and my family during this time of need. My father passed away suddenly and I needed a bereavement rate. They provided it with ease, saving my two sons $600 each over the price of another carrier. On the plane, they offered a selection of snacks including Kind bars which were a great alternative to pretzels. I was treated well by every member staff. I can't say enough about how great Delta is. When I fly in the future my choice will be Delta."
1994,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Toronto,May 2017,2,4,3,,1,2,1,0,✅ Verified Review ,"  Flew Delta Air Lines from Atlanta to Toronto. I have been flying for years, never before have I had such a bad experience as this one. Not only did they run out of space to put away my small carry-on luggage but, they also could not reach all their customers with drinks and food. This will probably be the last time I fly with Delta. Having a delayed flight is normal but, with all these other factors that went into the poor flight, this will have to be the last time."
1995,1,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Las Vegas ,May 2017,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,0,✅ Verified Review ,"  Flew Detroit to Las Vegas with Delta Air Lines. Very uncomfortable. I thought since this was a bigger plane, that the seats would be larger. Nope. The airline staff also skipped over me during the snacks and beverages. This is also the only flight in which I got a terrible headache from the sound of the plane. Lastly, the headrest video/music player did not work well enough to be able to watch or listen to much. Big disappointment."
1996,3,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Atlanta,May 2017,3,3,3,3,1,2,2,0,✅ Verified Review ,"  Boston to Atlanta. Still waiting at the airport, my flight was changed and delayed 3 times, all they blame is on Boston Logan airport, due to construction. Don't they know in advance the going construction ? And change their flights in advance too we been waiting here for 6 hours and Delta is not doing anything for us, worst customer service."
1997,10,A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Rome to New York JFK,April 2017,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,1,✅ Verified Review ,"  Excellent flight from Rome to New York on Delta Air Lines. Check in at Rome was fast and efficient. The Business Class seat was extremely comfortable. The cabin staff and service was excellent, friendly and polite. The IFE had several choices between music, movies, ant TV. The inflight meals and beverages were outstanding with ample choices. This was an excellent experience with Delta and I will be happy to fly with them again in the future."
1998,10,Boeing 767-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Honolulu to Singapore via Narita,May 2017,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,✅ Verified Review ,"  Honolulu to Singapore via Narita. Two wonderful flights proving American carriers can give equal or better service if they choose. Lounges, seats, staff, entertainment were all as close to perfect as it gets. Crews were different but very friendly and efficient on both legs. Bravo to Delta for picking up their game. They have won my loyalty."
