INTRO

This Jupyter notebook covers data on the 2000 most recent reviews for Delta Airlines from airlinequality.com. The dataset was collected on November 17th, 2023, but the code for the scraper used to collect the data was provided alongside this notebook.


SCRAPER

The data was collected by a web scraping bot built using a library called Beautiful Soup. It scraped the HTML off of 20 pages with 100 reviews each from a website called airlineequality.com for Delta's reviews. On the website, reviewers are asked to leave an overall rating and rate the airline's  seat comfort, staff service, food and beverages, inflight entertainment, ground service, wifi, value on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. In addition, they left a recommendation along with a text review and information on their aircraft, cabin designation, route, and date flown.

The data collection algorithm worked in this fashion. Initially, a list was created for each variable to be entered into for each review. Each review would therefore be sorted in order of newest to oldest. For each page, save each review into the appropriate bucket with the appropriate format (handled by get_proper_cell_content). Then, delete every first entry from the lists whenever you switch page, since that review is an aggregate rating. Next, the dataframe was built and a verified customer section was added depending on whether they had one of various checkmark emojis present in the beginning of their review.
